I live in a country that was beautiful.
"I saw kids to lose their parents, their stomachs and that with 10 or sweet years they had to take their families, to be the head of family and try to protect their brothers, and their mothers."
"When you look at the eyes, any 1,000 years is waiting for the future, but there was an unatable sadness in this girl that I could translate to the rest of the world, that moment, I think all the work that was done by the global HIV fund of HIV/AIDS."
