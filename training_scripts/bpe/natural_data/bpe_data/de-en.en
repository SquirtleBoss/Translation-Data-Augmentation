"@@ Like the man in Texas, five years ago on Christmas E@@ ve, who told us he only felt pleasure when he inf@@ lic@@ ted pain and he wanted to kill women and was going to do it that very night."
It can be used in interesting way@@ s.
"@@ No, we learned something else."
That's a terrible story.
And we have not been able to do that in a robo@@ t.
"@@ It's a super@@ -@@ wal@@ do that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sex@@ y, the car is sex@@ y. And if you're full of road ra@@ ge, you've got a ""@@ Ch@@ ev@@ y: Like a Rock@@ ,"" right?"
So what I've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look clo@@ sely and if you look from a different and a new point of vie@@ w.
N@@ A: M@@ m@@ -@@ h@@ mm@@ .
These min@@ ers do a lot of work.
"F@@ rom there, conf@@ usion and mis@@ understanding occur@@ , and the ten@@ sion build@@ s."
"So that is the progra@@ m, em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ingly simple, but as we're going to see, extremely power@@ ful."
"@@ And I sus@@ pect that if you asked someone who did know how to re@@ ad, say a member of the cl@@ erg@@ y, ""What percentage of the population do you think is even capable of read@@ ing@@ ?"""

(Applause) It's not lo@@ ving a man that makes life harder for gay gu@@ ys.
"@@ I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M@@ ."
"@@ And so, in their hon@@ or, I want to offer you this bl@@ ank sli@@ de."
"@@ (Laughter) Well, except they've been pre-@@ war@@ ned now, and they'll know you're making it up."
"@@ The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,@@ 300 soldi@@ ers."
Re@@ pe@@ ated phr@@ ases are assem@@ bled into them@@ es.
To@@ day when you go to Bo@@ sni@@ a it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 1990@@ s happened.
We just have to find them the right place.
"@@ It would be nice to be objective in life, in many ways."
An entrepren@@ eur doesn't expect a regular pay@@ che@@ ck.
"@@ Th@@ ose are on the rise, and we see people ex@@ press@@ ing interest in those cap@@ abilities and a desire to emplo@@ y them."
"@@ Technolog@@ y is ra@@ cing ahe@@ ad, but it's leaving more and more people beh@@ ind@@ ."
You know the bio@@ tech companies are actually going inside us and plan@@ ting their little flag@@ s on our gen@@ es.
"@@ Now, were it quite that easy, ge@@ ologists would re@@ jo@@ ic@@ e."
"@@ It's a powerful thing. It's like mag@@ ic, al@@ mo@@ st, like the mag@@ ici@@ ans we've seen at TED@@ . It's mag@@ ic."
"A@@ fter my daughter died I also spent a long time hom@@ eless, living under an over@@ pass in a kind of profound state of z@@ om@@ bie g@@ rief and loss that some of us en@@ counter along the way."
"S@@ ever@@ al years ago, there was one African girl@@ ."
"@@ It's easy to be anxi@@ ous in such ev@@ ents, but try che@@ cking for the lat@@ est information at several points in the day, rather than every few minutes, allowing time for complete det@@ ails to emer@@ ge and false repor@@ ts to be refu@@ ted."
P@@ ut@@ ting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem.
And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TEDTal@@ k today.
"@@ And this time, I don't like it, I didn't want to give into it, but there's a difference between a non-@@ stop swim and a stag@@ ed swi@@ m."

"@@ And if you're luck@@ y, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the cur@@ ve, and it'll spread@@ ."
One of the things that I found useful on my own heal@@ ing journey is educ@@ ating myself about sexual viol@@ ence.
And you can see those different w@@ rin@@ kl@@ es actually show up as she anim@@ at@@ es.
"@@ You have the mark@@ ings of Vis@@ hn@@ u on the left, so we could think of Vis@@ hn@@ u as the conserv@@ ative go@@ d."
Th@@ anks very much. (Applause)
"@@ I sometimes respon@@ d, and other times I let the art talk for itself."
How many are three billi@@ on@@ ?
"W@@ e didn't calcul@@ ate that precis@@ ely, but we understand that's very expen@@ si@@ ve."
She absolutely loves her reflec@@ tion.
"@@ A 10 or 20 percent impro@@ vement in the efficiency of every cool@@ ing system could actually have an enormous impact on our greenhouse gas emis@@ sion@@ s, both today and later this century."
"So if someone said, ""My lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent@@ ,"" and we said, ""Hey, good new@@ s."
"W@@ ell, a man named Haus@@ dor@@ ff in 19@@ 19 introduced a number which was just a mathematical jok@@ e, and I found that this number was a good meas@@ ure@@ ment of rough@@ ness."
"So here is the build@@ ing; it looks rather un@@ assum@@ ing, re@@ ally."
It wasn't like a TED con@@ fer@@ ence.
"All animal species do it, even though we all use slightly different tool@@ s."
"@@ And it turns out that when you're anxi@@ ous you squ@@ ir@@ t neural transmit@@ ters in the brain, which foc@@ uses you makes you dep@@ th-@@ fir@@ st."
"@@ But it was a dream of h@@ is, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them."
These are just trick@@ s.
"@@ Now, there are few words to describe the all-@@ consum@@ ing feelings of vulner@@ ability, sha@@ me, upset and in@@ justice that I was rid@@ den with in that moment and for the weeks to come."
"@@ It happened to be down at a place called St@@ en@@ nis Sp@@ ace Center right on the G@@ ul@@ f Co@@ ast, so we lived in a little town called Wa@@ vel@@ and, Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i, nice mo@@ dest house, and as you can see, it's up against a stor@@ m sur@@ ge."
And I then became a de@@ progra@@ mmer@@ .
(Laughter) I'd like to have a word about Val@@ d@@ é@@ s@@ 's drawing skill@@ s.
But obviously the point is that numbers are ma@@ ps.
"B@@ y the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour@@ ."
(Applause) (Appl@@ ause end@@ s) So I think we have to embrace a different metap@@ hor@@ .
That's it.
"In education, medic@@ ine, la@@ w, diplom@@ ac@@ y, government, business and the media that exist today."
"L@@ ater on, we took them home."
"@@ It may even increase our risk of car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular disease and of im@@ pair@@ ing our execu@@ tive function@@ ing, the very skill sets we need to do our jobs well."
"@@ And you also see this yellow activ@@ ity, which represents regions where con@@ trast is decre@@ as@@ ing; it's going from light to dar@@ k."
"@@ And I went into the lob@@ by of Men@@ 's F@@ it@@ ness magazin@@ e, the same maga@@ zine that had put us on that list five years before."
The ones that are very different are far@@ ther apar@@ t.
D@@ on't you sometimes wish you could fly like a bir@@ d?
""@@ "D@@ on't you want to leave anything beh@@ ind@@ ?"""
It's how they find the hydro@@ ther@@ mal vent@@ s.
It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynam@@ ic.
A@@ gei@@ s@@ m feed@@ s on den@@ ial -- our rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ac@@ knowledge that we are going to become that older person@@ .
"@@ And he said, ""W@@ hen I got to the sen@@ ior year of school, my teachers didn't take it seri@@ ously."
"W@@ e can't have anything to do with you@@ ."" (Laughter) So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) — and his par@@ ting com@@ ment as we sho@@ ok hands was, ""L@@ ist@@ en, if you happen to raise any money out of this, we'll gl@@ ad@@ ly take it@@ ."" (Laughter) So my lesson that year was persist@@ ence."
So you don't kick@@ . But you do use a small fli@@ ck.
"@@ And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that."
"@@ Po@@ or people are not only still poor, they are still un@@ health@@ y."
"@@ It monit@@ ors weather data from all the ground st@@ ations and optim@@ iz@@ es the rou@@ tes of the vehic@@ les through the system to avoid adver@@ se weather condi@@ tions, avoid other risk factor@@ s, and optim@@ ize the use of the resources throughout the net@@ work."
"@@ And in fact I would visit friends of min@@ e, and I noticed that they had water that came right into their hom@@ es."
And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.
"@@ I'm really afra@@ id, because I think the kinds of changes we can reason@@ ably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough."
This shows you a pat@@ ent landscape@@ .
"@@ I mean, if you're like me, math and logic is not eas@@ y."

"A@@ t the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacter@@ ia, the Pro@@ ch@@ l@@ or@@ o@@ cocc@@ i -- that will be on the final ex@@ am -- although discovered only in 198@@ 8, are now recogn@@ ized as likely the most abund@@ ant organisms on Earth, and mor@@ e@@ over, responsible for a large part of the photo@@ synthes@@ is that occur@@ s in the ocean."
This plo@@ t shows two members of a pair@@ .
"@@ And the title of my talk was therefore ""@@ Indian innovation from Gand@@ hi to Gand@@ hi@@ an engine@@ er@@ ing."""
Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new dec@@ ep@@ tions we've been tra@@ cking and document@@ ing.
"O@@ ne particular thing we might look at, in terms of long-term flo@@ ws of people, is what percentage of the world's population is accoun@@ ted for by fir@@ st-@@ generation imm@@ igran@@ ts@@ ?"
"W@@ hat I'm really curious about is if one day, it will be possible to re@@ pair@@ , re@@ build and au@@ g@@ ment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kit@@ chen@@ ."
"@@ But the AI era of dis@@ covery continu@@ ed, and more scientists p@@ ou@@ red their sou@@ ls into it."
W@@ ell people have spec@@ ul@@ ated that it was 201@@ 4 World C@@ up so@@ cc@@ er f@@ ans that brought the virus into the country.
And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forwar@@ d-@@ looking indic@@ ator@@ s.
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photograph@@ s that you've actually tak@@ en.
"@@ Ho@@ wever, Google didn't set@@ tle for that this time, they just thought, ""@@ That's rac@@ ist and it's a bad search result and we're going to go back and clean that up manu@@ ally."
Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important.
"@@ And those algorithms would be em@@ bed@@ ded in computers, and the computers would make decisions along with me@@ ; and so in par@@ all@@ el, we would make these decision@@ s."
"@@ If the Kur@@ ds can control their pip@@ el@@ in@@ es, they can set the terms of their own stat@@ eh@@ oo@@ d."
"@@ Th@@ en we said, ""Well, what are we going to do with the space during the day, because it has to be used before 2@@ :@@ 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ ?"""
We know because it says so inside the co@@ de.
"@@ U@@ sing the tools of synthetic biology, we can har@@ ness D@@ ein@@ o@@ cocc@@ us radio@@ dur@@ ans@@ ' ability to thri@@ ve under otherwise very le@@ th@@ al do@@ ses of radi@@ ation."
I@@ magine what a game chang@@ er that would be.
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.
The Cre@@ ative Com@@ mon@@ s lic@@ ens@@ es.
"So I think in the future, materials will evol@@ ve, and they will look and feel like fabri@@ cs we know today, like cot@@ ton or sil@@ k."
"@@ And I'll tell you more about it, but just ..."
"@@ But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dro@@ pping i@@ Po@@ ds not bom@@ bs -- I mean, it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Fried@@ man's new book@@ ."
And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the se@@ a.
"@@ (Laughter) ""@@ You@@ 've achie@@ ved nothing -- commit@@ ."
"@@ Like that, my fiction as well."
"@@ And there was something about this place, I didn't know why, that just felt speci@@ al."
"W@@ ell, it's probably micros@@ co@@ pic@@ , and it's never easy to study micros@@ cop@@ ic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater dep@@ th, at much smaller scal@@ es than ever before."
No arms at all.
"O@@ ne has to do with imagin@@ ation, the other with organiz@@ ation."
"An@@ d, most important, they need to learn to respect learn@@ ing."
"@@ And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be transl@@ ated into one of these tile programs -- spec@@ ific@@ ally, coun@@ ting."
"@@ (Laughter) China has many great po@@ ets, but we discovered that in the Pe@@ op@@ le's Republi@@ c public school cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um, they have three fair@@ y tal@@ es by An T@@ u Sh@@ eng@@ , or H@@ ans Christ@@ ian Ander@@ son, as we call him."
"Oh, I wish I'd had those spar@@ k@@ ly whe@@ els back then to have shown him, man@@ !"
"W@@ ell, okay, that's a crazy though@@ t."
"T@@ o make progres@@ s, we need to break the co@@ de."
"A@@ t first, it was friends and colleagu@@ es."
But I wasn't into selling whis@@ key@@ ; I was into selling ic@@ e.
"@@ This is O@@ EC@@ D -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN@@ ."
"O@@ n June 2@@ 3, 2000, a ship named the T@@ reas@@ ure s@@ ank off the co@@ ast of C@@ ap@@ e To@@ wn, South Africa, sp@@ ill@@ ing 1,@@ 300 tons of fu@@ el, which poll@@ ut@@ ed the habit@@ ats of nearly half the entire world population of African pen@@ gu@@ in@@ s."
"All this information is stor@@ ed for at least six months, up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provi@@ der."
This is the world we live in.
"@@ Fin@@ ally, the more approach@@ able, the more in@@ clusi@@ ve, and the more diverse we make the world of technology, the more color@@ ful and better the world will look like."
"@@ And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecul@@ e that con@@ tains that information."
"@@ (Laughter) But one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could test@@ -@@ run a piece of equipment in my mind, just like a virtual reality computer system."
I am here to tell you that change is in the air@@ .
W@@ hy? Because that profit allows whatever solution we've created to be infin@@ itely scal@@ able.
"W@@ hat we now know is that your immune cells, which are the white blood cells cour@@ sing through your bloo@@ d@@ stre@@ am, protect you on a daily basis from things gone bad -- including cancer@@ ."
We were hung@@ ry.
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.
(Laughter) And maybe you even offer some sugges@@ tions.
And the reason the immune system has trouble with most canc@@ ers is that it doesn't inv@@ ade from the out@@ side@@ ; it evol@@ ves from its own cell@@ s.
"@@ I sat with him, and I said, ""@@ Gen@@ e, you have lived in America for 100 years."
"@@ These are different war@@ s, with different religious fac@@ tions, different political fac@@ tions, and different soci@@ o@@ economic problems."

"@@ But if you look out to the near@@ est set of star@@ s, to the near@@ est 40 or 50 star@@ s, it's about 10 years."
"@@ The only thing they didn't have is that they didn't have their own national television st@@ ation, and so I remember watching TV from neighbor@@ ing South Africa, and watching Nelson Mandel@@ a in ja@@ il being offered a chance to come out if he would give up the apar@@ thei@@ d strugg@@ le."
"So we said, let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challen@@ ges, or certain kinds of economic experiment@@ s."
"@@ Be@@ fore the end of 201@@ 1, B@@ en Ali@@ , and Mu@@ bar@@ ak@@ , and G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i would be down, and pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ted."

"@@ And when you get there, you come to Harv@@ ard@@ 's biggest meeting place and class@@ room."
"@@ And we said, ""W@@ ell what about play and rec@@ ess@@ ?"""
And so they wait for these concent@@ rated po@@ ol@@ s of fish to be able to feed enough to feed their yo@@ ung.
I live in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as.

"O@@ f course, computers and electron@@ ics are now Americ@@ a's biggest industr@@ y, while ty@@ pe@@ writer mak@@ ers have v@@ an@@ ish@@ ed."
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blo@@ g.
It's the history of what we eat today.
"@@ I remember what it was like when I was stuck in that bedro@@ om, when it had been months since I had seen the sun@@ ."
"@@ It's not change or technology that threat@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is power, the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation."

Let's talk about social psycholog@@ y.
"@@ But if that's true, why do some people, like the str@@ anger who res@@ cu@@ ed me, do sel@@ fl@@ ess things, like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselv@@ es?"

"@@ The claim to f@@ ame of Y@@ a@@ hoo@@ ! was, we hire people to look -- origin@@ ally, not any@@ more -- we hire people to look at web@@ sites and tell you -- if they're in the inde@@ x, they're good.

No one own@@ s it, no one own@@ s the out@@ p@@ ut, it's free for anyone to use and it's the out@@ put of people acting out of social and psychological motiv@@ ations to do something interest@@ ing."
"B@@ ecause of that, social d@@ ances bubble up, they change and they spread like wild@@ fire@@ ."
He runs ES@@ P@@ N@@ .
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mo@@ p flo@@ ors and empty tr@@ ash can@@ s.

"@@ I was completely terrif@@ ied, completely bro@@ ken, and kept trying to find a new language, a new way to make sense of all of this."

"In sal@@ mon a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture, we kick@@ ed off a ro@@ und@@ table almost six years ago."
And the way to do that is to understand where trust w@@ ob@@ bles for ourselves and have a read@@ y-@@ made prescrip@@ tion to overcome it.
"S@@ o, for example, here on the left we can see a s@@ now@@ fl@@ ake as it would appear in nature."
This looks like something out of a Dr. Se@@ uss book -- just all mann@@ er of creatures all over this thing.

"A@@ s a repor@@ ter and as a foreig@@ ner, I've learned that neutr@@ ality, sil@@ ence and fear aren't the best op@@ tions -- not in journ@@ alism, nor in life."

"@@ And we found in our pre-@@ clinical work that you can im@@ plant these sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds into the body, and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things ali@@ ve."
"@@ And in hir@@ ing or promo@@ tion or ann@@ ual raise disc@@ us@@ sion@@ s, an employ@@ er can use that secre@@ cy to save a lot of mone@@ y."

So 15@@ .@@ 5 seconds is the medi@@ an time for subjects in his experiment there.
"@@ But even today, that memory is still in people's mind@@ s."
But it didn't matter down in that tun@@ n@@ el.
The thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news.
"In about the first billi@@ on@@ th of a second or so, the Higgs field kick@@ ed in, and the quar@@ ks and the glu@@ ons and the elec@@ tr@@ ons that make us up got mas@@ s."

The things we make have one su@@ pre@@ me quality -- they live longer than us.
I went to high school.
"@@ I believe that we need to create African institu@@ tions, hom@@ e-@@ grow@@ n, that will identify and develop these leaders in a systema@@ tic, practical way."
"@@ And he saw this, and he was so excit@@ ed, he reached his hand out to me, and he said, ""@@ Thank you, thank you, thank you."""
"@@ But if you text now, or if you are someone who is aware of the sub@@ str@@ ate of tex@@ ting the way it's be@@ come, you'll notice that L@@ O@@ L does not mean laugh@@ ing out l@@ oud any@@ more."
So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more el@@ ast@@ ic.
"@@ It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slow@@ ly."
We have four computer@@ s. We have two par@@ ach@@ ut@@ es.
"@@ It's really cal@@ m@@ ing, it's quite warm and it has a fla@@ vor a little bit like so@@ da water."
"W@@ ith a 3D visu@@ alization like this, we can not only just say Vo@@ yager 1 flew by Satur@@ n."
"W@@ ell, these objec@@ tions were perfectly reason@@ able a few years ago, but things have change@@ d."
"So I actually know a lot about building a pe@@ er platform now, and a Pe@@ ers, In@@ c@@ . company, because I've spent the last two years doing that in Par@@ is."
"@@ And third is that physical things are read@@ able on a map -- so restauran@@ ts, a variety of venu@@ es, but also with GPS and other technology like R@@ F@@ I@@ D and it continues to exp@@ and beyond that, we can also track things that are mov@@ ing, like a car, a tax@@ ic@@ ab, a trans@@ it system, a box that's moving through time and space."
"B@@ ecause you're intelligent and you speak English@@ , you know the word at the end of this sent@@ ence."
"@@ The bigger issue – The bigger issue with ""@@ fin@@ e"" is that you say it to your@@ self."
"I@@ mag@@ ine, for example, a national home@@ work assign@@ ment where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country recor@@ ds an inter@@ view with an el@@ der over Th@@ ank@@ s@@ gi@@ ving, so that in one single week@@ end an entire generation of American lives and experiences are cap@@ ture@@ d."
G@@ ood people had been put in a very bad situation for question@@ able resul@@ ts.

"@@ I met B@@ enk@@ i three years ago in Sa@@ o Pau@@ l@@ o when I'd brought him and other leaders from indi@@ gen@@ ous peo@@ ples to meet with me and leaders from around the world, because we wanted to learn from each other."
"B@@ ecause if we are the environment, then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other."

You're looking for something that comes and hits you.
So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with.
You will never be as young as you are right now.
"""@@ This is Ma@@ j@@ or Tom to Gro@@ und Contro@@ l, I'm stepping through the door And I'm flo@@ ating in a most pec@@ uli@@ ar way And the stars look very different today."
I accum@@ ul@@ ated a lot of money when I think about it.
Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life.
"J@@ im E@@ w@@ ing: The morning after the first time I was attached to the robo@@ t, my daughter came down@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and asked me how it felt to be a cy@@ bor@@ g, and my answer was that I didn't feel like a cy@@ bor@@ g."

"@@ Now, I can tell you that it's easy a lot, but I think a really good way to prove that is to gra@@ b a second one and la@@ unch it."
"W@@ h@@ ich means, yes, I have a little sha@@ me@@ ; no, I'm a soci@@ opath@@ ."

"So in clos@@ ing, as you think about technology tr@@ ends and how to impact health and medic@@ ine, we're entering an era of min@@ i@@ atur@@ iz@@ ation, de@@ centr@@ alization and person@@ aliz@@ ation."

It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior.
"@@ And the pain@@ ful part of that moment was the awar@@ eness that the emp@@ tin@@ ess in my apart@@ ment was just reflec@@ tive of the emp@@ tin@@ ess in myself, and that I had fallen for some of the lies that our culture tells us."
So the in@@ cl@@ usion ag@@ end@@ a means genu@@ in@@ ely bringing people inside the t@@ ent.
I came up with these six sent@@ ences after much experiment@@ ation.
"@@ I wonder whether we might help ourselves to underst@@ and, say, quantum theory, if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhoo@@ d, which had a mak@@ e-@@ believe world of ball@@ s going through two sli@@ ts on a scre@@ en, a world in which the strange go@@ ing@@ s-@@ on of quantum mechan@@ ics were en@@ lar@@ ged by the computer@@ 's mak@@ e-@@ believe, so that they became familiar on the Mid@@ d@@ le-@@ World scale of the stream@@ ."
"In Africa, super@@ st@@ ition is wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad, with so many people believing in wit@@ ch@@ cra@@ ft, something that has no basis in reason or in sci@@ ence."

I ask myself that frequ@@ ent@@ ly.
"W@@ here you den@@ y the other person's reality, you have parado@@ x where you allow more than one reality to co@@ ex@@ ist, I think there's another philosoph@@ ical construc@@ tion."

"So by compar@@ ing how similar G@@ C@@ S@@ E results are in iden@@ tical tw@@ ins versus non@@ iden@@ tical tw@@ ins and doing some cle@@ ver ma@@ th@@ s, we can get an idea of how much vari@@ ation in performance is due to the environment, and how much is due to gen@@ es."
It's a very slow process.
"@@ Now take this together, and you end up with 2.@@ 3 million words of TED Tal@@ ks, which is about three Bi@@ bl@@ es-@@ worth of cont@@ ent."

So we actually explor@@ ed this idea in our lab@@ .
"W@@ hat all of these seem@@ ingly dis@@ par@@ ate works recogn@@ iz@@ e, the con@@ cl@@ usion that they all re@@ ach, is that a society in which people can be monit@@ or@@ ed at all times is a society that bre@@ eds con@@ form@@ ity and o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and sub@@ mis@@ sion, which is why every ty@@ ran@@ t, the most over@@ t to the most sub@@ tle, cra@@ ves that system."
"@@ And that was a stro@@ ke of absolute geni@@ us, because what they did was they har@@ n@@ essed the power of the contrac@@ t, private power, to deliver public goo@@ ds."
Here's me in my offic@@ e.
"W@@ e can feel ang@@ ry at the same time that we're scar@@ ed or sa@@ d, or feeling a ho@@ st of other emo@@ tions."
"In this case, what Mi@@ ke is doing is var@@ ying y over the space of different animals, in a network designed to recognize and distingu@@ ish different animals from each other."
"@@ And a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top@@ ."
We would give credit to someone we know or that we live next to.
"So we went to lunch -- (Laughter) And I've got to tell you, this was one seri@@ ously quiet lun@@ ch."
"@@ It shr@@ in@@ ks our mind@@ s, for sure, but it also shr@@ in@@ ks our hear@@ ts, to such an extent that we become num@@ b to the suffering of other people."
"T@@ al@@ k about sustainable invest@@ ment, no one is interes@@ ted."
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
"@@ Bi@@ ologists term pro@@ creative success to mean the age where you have children and then another gener@@ ation, the age when your children have children."
"@@ The Li@@ brary of Con@@ gres@@ s, if you did the whole dar@@ n thing -- 26 million books -- is about 7@@ 50 million dollars, right?"

So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're go@@ ing.
"@@ This may seem min@@ or, but it is terrif@@ ying to hear r@@ um@@ or after r@@ um@@ or after r@@ um@@ or that another ti@@ d@@ al wa@@ ve, bigger than the la@@ st, will be coming at exactly 1 p@@ .@@ m., or perhaps ton@@ ight, or perhaps ..."
"@@ This guy is not sky@@ div@@ ing. H@@ e's being flo@@ wn like a kit@@ e, or moved around like a kit@@ e."
"@@ And this is demonstr@@ ating that through random energy, we can build non-@@ random shap@@ es."
"Man@@ : We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here and enjoy the walk@@ ing, cit@@ y's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nic@@ est place of Banglad@@ es@@ h."
It's made -- the ch@@ ari@@ o@@ t is made of gol@@ d.
I@@ t@@ ’s already fl@@ atten@@ ing out.
"@@ And over that time, I've seen a lot of crazy things in the market@@ s, and I've tra@@ ded a lot of crazy man@@ i@@ as@@ ."
It's not a new question.
"@@ The map shows each and every st@@ ation, each and every station nam@@ e, and I'm also dis@@ playing side stre@@ ets."
"@@ And you can see two layers of fi@@ bers, one in blue and one in yel@@ lo@@ w, arrang@@ ed in left-@@ handed and righ@@ t-@@ handed ang@@ l@@ es."
Let's go to approach@@ es.
"@@ And if we defe@@ at these, as I hope we do, more is com@@ ing."
I was in a wheel@@ chair@@ ; I didn't look like a loo@@ ter.
"@@ They just work together, and never the same group twi@@ ce, not knowing what's going to happen nex@@ t."
"Al@@ ong with our lo@@ go@@ s, too, which I think really em@@ body our culture when we change things."
"@@ (Laughter) Now, while he's probably not talking about it publi@@ cl@@ y, I am@@ ."
It gets even more complicated when the doc@@ tr@@ ines of use become am@@ big@@ u@@ ous.
"@@ And the result of that is, we're going to generate 8@@ 3@@ ,000 new job@@ s, four billion dollars a year in ann@@ ual in@@ come, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 17@@ 4 million tons a year."
One is found in train@@ ing.
"@@ And that was fascinating to me as a game design@@ er, because it never occur@@ s to me, should I make the game about this difficult topic or not@@ ?"
(Laughter) It's fairly self-@@ explan@@ ator@@ y.
"@@ But if a tex@@ t@@ book seems too much f@@ un, it's somehow uns@@ ci@@ enti@@ f@@ ic."
"@@ And then they rep@@ ack@@ age them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a ster@@ ile sy@@ r@@ inge in the first place, which is quite bizar@@ re."
"@@ And the ep@@ it@@ ome was when I literally mar@@ ched into the streets of N@@ y@@ am@@ i@@ ra@@ m@@ bo@@ , which is the popular quarter of K@@ ig@@ ali@@ , with a bu@@ ck@@ et, and I sold all these little d@@ ough@@ nut@@ s to people, and I came back, and I was like, ""You se@@ e?"""
We don't see the orig@@ in of speci@@ es.
I don't know in in@@ ches how much that is.
"@@ Ho@@ wever, the other individuals are repres@@ ented by these blue sli@@ des, which show too@@ th and bone samples that were mat@@ ched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identi@@ ties of those individu@@ als."
"@@ And inside, the day@@ light -- each one is an op@@ tic and it brings light into the cen@@ ter."
But we don’t need to know what an animal is thinking in order to det@@ ect dec@@ ep@@ tion.
"@@ And unfortunately, the hel@@ ium atoms in liquid hel@@ ium are right on top of each other."
"@@ then I'm Japan@@ es@@ e, because I've been living as much as I can for the last 25 years in Jap@@ an."
"@@ Now, it's pretty obvious at this point there's a zone here in the midd@@ le."
"So there it sit@@ s on our shel@@ ves ob@@ sol@@ ete to us, but with immediate lat@@ ent value to someone else."
Because who has to have a so@@ ap@@ box when all you've ever needed is your voic@@ e?
Can we build a creative computer@@ ?
"S@@ o, it's not true that there's no solution@@ ; there is a solution@@ !"
"@@ Now, Mount Ever@@ est is actually an interesting compar@@ ison of a new approach to how we interact with our environ@@ ments, as it's often given the du@@ bi@@ ous honor of being the world's highest gar@@ bage d@@ ump@@ ."
"@@ I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of explor@@ ation on Earth is over, that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deep@@ est oceans in order to find something significant to explor@@ e."
We're holding ourselves back because we don't value pla@@ y.
"@@ But we feel for them, and that mat@@ ters, because if we're trying to integr@@ ate robots into these shared spac@@ es, we need to understand that people will treat them differently than other devic@@ es, and that in some cases, for example, the case of a soldi@@ er who becomes emotion@@ ally attached to the robot that they work with, that can be anything from in@@ efficient to danger@@ ous."
"@@ And I don't where I got it from, but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lak@@ e."
"@@ They make new cell phones like kids in Pal@@ o Al@@ to make web@@ sit@@ es, and so there's a rain@@ forest of innovation going on in the cell ph@@ one."
"R@@ a@@ ther, they're taken as primi@@ tive, and you build up the world from there."
"E@@ ach is as real as every other, in the sense that there are many univers@@ es, each with a different shap@@ e, for the extra dimension@@ s."
"@@ The worst of times can be the best of times, because certain tru@@ ths fl@@ ash up in ways that you can't ignor@@ e."
It may seem like the se@@ mic@@ ol@@ on is struggling with an identity cris@@ is.
"@@ Th@@ en, I form@@ ulate assump@@ tions about how these elements interact with each other and with their environment."
"In fact, we've developed proto@@ col@@ s that enable us to even suggest what brand of con@@ dom might have been us@@ ed."
So I decided to sign on.
"R@@ ustin was passed over for several influ@@ ential ro@@ les in the 1960@@ s and 70@@ s, but he never stopped his activ@@ ism."
"@@ And then, I was overwhel@@ med with sha@@ me."
"@@ They have an increased risk of infec@@ tion, an increased risk of mal@@ ign@@ anc@@ y."
So let me introduce you to the j@@ it@@ ne@@ y.
"@@ They underst@@ and, in that contex@@ t, ""@@ free@@ ."" They understand ""@@ free@@ "" is an important essential part of the cultural ec@@ ology as well."
Amazon is our consum@@ p@@ tive gut.
So these are actually two bro@@ thers consum@@ mat@@ ing a relationship@@ .
"@@ I mean, T@@ iger sur@@ ely was actually o@@ be@@ ying the Ac@@ cent@@ ure model@@ ."
You can have fun with pain@@ t.
I used a micros@@ cop@@ ic sh@@ ard of diam@@ ond to actually car@@ ve the actual bas@@ e.
I found it my@@ self.
"@@ But as we de@@ code their natural sound@@ s, we're also planning to put those back into the computer@@ ized system."
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponenti@@ ally.
One more mind will be un@@ lock@@ ed.
"@@ Th@@ ink about it. Now, in design ter@@ ms, a wheel@@ cha@@ ir is a very difficult objec@@ t."
"W@@ om@@ an: All right, fa@@ ther."
"@@ (Laughter) So when Mah@@ ar@@ i was lea@@ ving, I asked him how he was cop@@ ing with feeling isol@@ ated."
The second pattern I ob@@ serve is the need for remem@@ br@@ ance.
"So I end my talk, really, where I started, talking about my own personal experience."
And so let's fly back in time to that memor@@ able moment.
"@@ I kept my identity a secret from my class@@ mat@@ es to avoid being target@@ ed, but as it turns out, being the qui@@ et, ch@@ ub@@ by new kid in class was more than enough amm@@ uni@@ tion."
Can we build systems that conver@@ se with humans in natural langu@@ age@@ ?
"S@@ o, the farmers go out at night with heav@@ ily arm@@ ed je@@ ep@@ s, and sh@@ ine the head@@ ligh@@ ts, and anything that doesn't look like a sheep@@ , you shoo@@ t."
"So what we do in my lab is to collabor@@ ate with neuro@@ biolog@@ ists like Je@@ an-@@ Mar@@ ie C@@ abel@@ gu@@ en, a neuro@@ biolog@@ ist in Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in Fran@@ ce, and we want to make spin@@ al cor@@ d models and val@@ id@@ ate them on robo@@ ts."
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on your@@ self.
We needed new bound@@ aries to describe our traditional land@@ s; we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether -- can GPS really refle@@ ct the true refle@@ ction of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West@@ ?
"A@@ t the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so excited that I had found this new life form."
"@@ A remarkable and counter@@ intui@@ tive phenomenon has been discover@@ ed, which scientists call Po@@ st Trau@@ matic Gro@@ w@@ th."
"@@ And this idea of creating a safe ha@@ ven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families -- I wanted that, but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,@@ 600 kids, and teachers turning over year after year after year."
"In sou@@ thern Sud@@ an, another civil war saw similar use of star@@ v@@ ation as a means of gen@@ oci@@ de."
"@@ And the areas that are dark on the map are either areas where people do not have access to that much energy, or areas where people do, but they have learned to stop sh@@ ining the light up into the sk@@ y."
"O@@ K, for me the street just rais@@ es so many different questions."
"Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are."
8@@ 8 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a bab@@ y.
95 percent of the glac@@ ier@@ s in the world are re@@ treating or shr@@ ink@@ ing.
"@@ Perhaps by the time we en@@ counter inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic life forms, we'll be able to communicate with them through a tiny gi@@ z@@ mo@@ , or we might have to start comp@@ iling that dic@@ tion@@ ary, after all."
"@@ This is the ""D@@ ou@@ ble R@@ a@@ ind@@ rop@@ ."""
"@@ And it's not just in factor@@ ies, but tru@@ ck@@ ers, drivers and even jobs like teles@@ al@@ es, custom@@ er service and hem@@ at@@ ologists as well as radi@@ ologists over the next 15 years are going to be gradu@@ ally re@@ placed by artificial intelligen@@ ce."
"@@ The princip@@ al says, ""I don't train them. We leave them on top of the ro@@ of."
"M@@ ore recently, in the last dec@@ ade, we begin to see these communities star@@ t, h@@ es@@ it@@ at@@ ingly, to come together."
It's very powerful work.
"@@ But in practic@@ e, it is extremely difficul@@ t."
How could f@@ oni@@ o par@@ take in this market shar@@ e?
"@@ It's dis@@ hear@@ ten@@ ing, it's sa@@ d."
It took 10 years of research and development to come up with a novel wing concept that only uses three wat@@ ts of power to control and yet can pro@@ pel a vehicle all around the glo@@ be with seem@@ ingly un@@ limited autonom@@ y.
I'm a big f@@ an of grass@@ roots organiz@@ ations.
"@@ It can fly up, down, forwar@@ ds, back@@ wards, even up@@ si@@ de-@@ down."
"T@@ win studies show a strong genetic compon@@ ent, although we don't know which genes are invol@@ ved."
"A@@ s a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very do@@ able, even before the 20@@ 15 time@@ fra@@ me. In other parts of emerging countries, such as India and China, the progress has been good -- has been soli@@ d, has been good. But in places that are not as develo@@ ped, places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world, the progress has been rather slo@@ w. As a matter of fact, I was just recently vis@@ iting South Afric@@ a."
"@@ And I'm a hypo@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ ac@@ , and I remember arm num@@ b means heart attack@@ ."
"@@ You're saying he@@ y, you know, I don't think I'm going to need them, so I'm just going to trust that, you know, let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter, these guys are going to do the right thing."
"@@ He would say, ""@@ You're right between hor@@ se and squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ , John@@ ."""
"@@ You had water, se@@ wer networks that allowed for this kind of un@@ che@@ cked expan@@ sion@@ ."
That the story of an Indian te@@ enager isn't vi@@ able in the domestic market@@ place or anywhere else in the world outside of Indi@@ a.
"@@ (Applause) Tom Ri@@ ell@@ y: So C@@ os@@ min@@ , tell me what hard@@ ware is this that they're rapidly putting a@@ way@@ ?"
"@@ Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to mak@@ e, and it was political dynam@@ it@@ e, fran@@ kl@@ y."
"A@@ s we zoom in on one of these pur@@ ple neur@@ ons, we see that its outer membran@@ e is stud@@ ded with micros@@ cop@@ ic por@@ es."
"S@@ o, that's happening in the U.@@ K. with U.@@ K. government data."
I was that ape@@ .
That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history.
"@@ And when it v@@ an@@ ish@@ es, Earth becomes Mar@@ s."
"@@ Now, would that this were just about Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in and her reality TV sho@@ w."
Because we humans can understand the mean@@ ing.
You're beginning to see the emergen@@ ce of a multi-@@ pol@@ ar world.
"@@ And this one in the middle here, the large tru@@ ck, is called the Ac@@ tive Den@@ ial System, something the US military is working on at the mom@@ ent."
"@@ Now, mamm@@ als are warm@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded creatur@@ es, and when we get cold, we sha@@ ke and we sh@@ iver@@ , right?"
"O@@ il costs our economy two billion dollars a day, plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military co@@ sts, raising its total cost to over a six@@ th of GD@@ P@@ ."
"In the time that pass@@ es between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teach@@ ing, we really see the adv@@ ent of the Internet@@ ."

"@@ You can go to O@@ R@@ CA@@ Te@@ ch@@ .@@ or@@ g -- it has nothing to do with whal@@ es, it's the O@@ reg@@ on Center for A@@ ging and Technolog@@ y -- to see more about that."
One of them starts in Ugan@@ da.
"W@@ e show it Willi@@ am Bl@@ ak@@ e, that's what it reflec@@ ts back to us."
"W@@ ash@@ ing is the anti@@ do@@ te to the sort of bu@@ gs, the common infec@@ tious diseases of the eyes, the ear@@ s, the ch@@ est and the skin that, if they occ@@ ur in the first five years of life, perman@@ ently damage those organ@@ s."
"H@@ el@@ ium sp@@ li@@ ts out, and a neutr@@ on comes out and lots of energy comes out."
"@@ And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data, a few of us have actually be@@ gun to call this information biological dark matter."

"@@ If you went and you were valu@@ ing two companies against one another, you'd want to know which was more valu@@ able."
"@@ But what, exac@@ tly, is spi@@ der sil@@ k@@ ?"
"@@ And so then I learned that listening is not only about wa@@ it@@ ing, but it's also learning how better to ask questions."

You can almost hear the dr@@ ums thro@@ b@@ bing back in that little cot@@ t@@ age where we stay when we're there.
"@@ I even think Chris said something like this y@@ ester@@ day, something like, it's one of the most complicated things in the universe."
"@@ And so at that time, of course, there was no re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation."
"@@ It takes more than de@@ cor@@ , but I think we@@ ’@@ ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbol@@ s in the work@@ place that remind people to be play@@ ful, and that it@@ ’s a per@@ mis@@ sive environment."

I became fascin@@ ated with using technology to help the sever@@ ely dis@@ able@@ d.

This is the key to making that experience really successful for kids.

"W@@ e have very, very smart people, who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem, and we have the technology to do this."
"In the next dec@@ ade, the z@@ one's human res@@ id@@ ents will be g@@ one, and it will rever@@ t to a wi@@ ld, radio@@ active place, full only of animals and occasion@@ ally dar@@ ing, fl@@ um@@ mo@@ x@@ ed scienti@@ st@@ s."
"W@@ hat if you're only going to be anon@@ ym@@ ous for 15 minut@@ es? (Laughter) Well, then, because of electronic tat@@ to@@ os, maybe all of you and all of us are very close to im@@ mortal@@ ity, because these tat@@ to@@ os will live far longer than our bodies will@@ ."
You have to force them to ba@@ the@@ . But you can do 15 minutes.
"W@@ hen we think of games, there's all kinds of things."
The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversit@@ y.
"O@@ ne of the Ac@@ umen F@@ und fel@@ lo@@ ws at my organiz@@ ation, S@@ ur@@ a@@ j Sud@@ ha@@ k@@ ar, has what we call moral imagin@@ ation -- the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspec@@ tive."
"W@@ hen the res@@ c@@ ue workers cam@@ e, they res@@ us@@ cit@@ ated him and there was no brain dama@@ ge."
T@@ rig@@ ger@@ -@@ pul@@ l@@ ers go this way.
"So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work, we need look only no far@@ ther than Africa to find these robust self-@@ organiz@@ ing algorith@@ ms."
"An@@ y set of statistics might have something l@@ ur@@ king inside it, something that can turn the results completely upside down."
So what are we going to do now -- now that we see the water@@ ?
"@@ (Laughter) Now, today as a tr@@ ans person, public bath@@ rooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be question@@ ed or har@@ as@@ se@@ d."
"So when a lock@@ er has an even number of factors it will remain clo@@ sed, and when it has an od@@ d number of factor@@ s, it will remain op@@ en."
So we can then ask for Den@@ iso@@ v@@ ans the same things as for the Ne@@ ander@@ thal@@ s: Did they mi@@ x with ancest@@ ors of present day people@@ ?
"@@ And over vast tra@@ c@@ ts of time, the impro@@ b@@ able becomes the probab@@ le."
And we were really optimist@@ ic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-@@ lived mut@@ ant.
So now you have no choice but to aband@@ on your car where it is on the high@@ way.
"@@ But that being said, we just as easily could have lost one of the ol@@ dest living things on the planet, and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be se@@ en."

Now let that sin@@ k in for a secon@@ d.
"T@@ in@@ y, fl@@ at and black as a pra@@ y@@ er st@@ one, it bu@@ zz@@ ed soft@@ ly and then slowly rose from the sand@@ ."

There's a lot of things to say about this question.
My two@@ - and four@@ -year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else.
T@@ J: It has to be compan@@ ies. It has to be civil societ@@ y.
So here's another one.
My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could@@ 've ever possibly imagin@@ ed.
"@@ I have one in my po@@ cket here from the first century B@@ C@@ E by Lu@@ cre@@ ti@@ us, the auth@@ or of ""O@@ n the Nat@@ ure of Th@@ ings@@ ,"" who said, ""T@@ antum religi@@ o po@@ tu@@ it su@@ a@@ der@@ e mal@@ or@@ um@@ "" -- I should have been able to learn that by heart — which is, that's how much religion is able to persu@@ ade people to do ev@@ il, and he was talking about the fact of A@@ gam@@ em@@ non@@ 's decision to place his daughter I@@ ph@@ ig@@ en@@ ia on an alt@@ ar of sac@@ rif@@ ice in order to pres@@ er@@ ve the pro@@ spec@@ ts of his arm@@ y."

"O@@ ther women are forced through degra@@ ding vir@@ gin@@ ity che@@ cks, simply to ob@@ tain a job, to save their reput@@ ation or to get marri@@ ed."
That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me think@@ ing: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predic@@ tion@@ s?
"@@ It's an objective truth about the form of two, the abstract form."
It was a sports summer cam@@ p for four@@ - to six@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds.
"So say on the order of tens of thous@@ and@@ s, hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn't exist before."
That's the same percentage as genetic red@@ head@@ s.
I realized I'd intern@@ alized these respon@@ ses and it had changed who I was on a core level@@ .
"@@ And under the inten@@ se conditions of a coast@@ er, gra@@ vit@@ y@@ ’s effects are multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed."

"So our son@@ s are going to have to find some way of adap@@ ting to this, some new relationship with each other, and I think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who tru@@ sts his sist@@ ers and respec@@ ts them, and wants to be on their te@@ am, and stands up against the real bad gu@@ ys, who are the men who want to ab@@ use the women."
One of my first experiences that challeng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tions.
It's because the pul@@ se of light is not coming back through the same not@@ ch.
I was so scar@@ ed.
And I did. And I think that's a really important part of the journe@@ y.
"So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly, so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this disc@@ ussion is this example of this c@@ at fe@@ e@@ der."

"@@ But those people from the past, they don't know about any of this."
"B@@ ecause when we are free from hat@@ e, we see the ones who hurt us not as mon@@ ster@@ s, but as people who themselves are w@@ oun@@ ded, who themselves feel threat@@ en@@ ed, who don't know what else to do with their in@@ security but to hurt us, to pull the trig@@ ger, or cast the vo@@ te, or pass the policy a@@ im@@ ed at us."

"@@ Th@@ en he took my fi@@ bul@@ a from my cal@@ f, cut it out and then rel@@ oc@@ ated it to my th@@ igh@@ , where it now lives."
"W@@ ell, if that's the case, good. Why hard instead of eas@@ y?"
"@@ (Laughter) But they said, ""No, but don't show any@@ on@@ e."""
Here's an experiment we did at Harv@@ ar@@ d.

I have to create a frame@@ work that you then fill in with your imagin@@ ation.
"@@ And in this scen@@ ari@@ o, not only was the Big B@@ ang not the beginning, as you can see from the picture, it can happen over and over again."
"So pres@@ ently, we are doing the fol@@ low@@ ing: First of all, we are de@@ com@@ posing the K@@ -@@ 12 math cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um into numer@@ ous such app@@ s."

"@@ It wasn't until days later as I lay in a com@@ a that the doctors diagno@@ sed me with bacterial men@@ ingiti@@ s, a vaccin@@ e-@@ prevent@@ able blood infec@@ tion."
The tri@@ age problem.
"@@ (Laughter) So they get to try again, and this time they got it right."
So let me show you why that's wron@@ g.
"T@@ D: So, every one of you who has come here is so tal@@ ent@@ ed, and you have so much to offer to the world, I think it would be a good note to conclu@@ de on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortun@@ ate we are to have come together in this way and ex@@ changed ideas and really form a strong as@@ pi@@ ration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this con@@ fer@@ ence, the moment@@ um, the posi@@ tiv@@ ity, and we will spread that and plant it in all of the cor@@ ners of the world."
"@@ But I think this is the thing, especially in Europe and for us, too, we need to be looking at."
The list on the right is also in@@ complet@@ e.
(Laughter) But I learned two things.
"@@ A woman came on the fourth day and appro@@ ached her and asked her to take another child -- a little bo@@ y, just four years old."
"An@@ y society can adop@@ t these institu@@ tions, and when they do, they achieve what the West achie@@ ved after 1@@ 500 -- only fast@@ er."

"@@ How can we share more memor@@ ies of our aband@@ on@@ ed build@@ ings, and gain a better understanding of our landscape@@ ?"
"@@ I think we could roll the tap@@ e, ad@@ min@@ ."
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.

And this is the question: who am I being that my play@@ ers@@ ' eyes are not sh@@ in@@ ing?
"E@@ ven though it's difficul@@ t, it's actually possible to do this."
(Laughter) And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scann@@ er and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's though@@ ts.

"So with that in mind, this particular inci@@ dent has led to the things that I'm working on now."

"So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us, that we'd be lon@@ ely forever@@ , that we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool@@ sh@@ ed."
M@@ any of these do-@@ it@@ -@@ yourself practic@@ es were lost in the second half of the 20@@ th century.
"@@ Now don't get me wrong, the later creation of fully developed writing was an impres@@ sive fe@@ at in its own right."
(Laughter) S@@ S: And my personal favorite is Fran@@ ken@@ st@@ ein@@ 's mon@@ ster@@ .
How do they decide on the number 5@@ 3@@ 8@@ ?
"So what extrem@@ ist groups are very good at is taking a very complic@@ ated, conf@@ us@@ ing, nu@@ anced world and simp@@ lif@@ ying that world into black and wh@@ it@@ e, good and ev@@ il."
But the new wave of pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ologists -- my graduate students -- collect biom@@ ark@@ ers.

"@@ It was neutr@@ al, imp@@ assi@@ ve and ev@@ en, after a while, strang@@ ely compan@@ ion@@ ate and re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing, although I did notice that its cal@@ m ex@@ ter@@ ior sometimes sli@@ pped and that it occasion@@ ally mir@@ ror@@ ed my own un@@ ex@@ pressed emo@@ tion."
That sounds bor@@ ing.
"@@ (Laughter) H@@ are said the reason why is because capit@@ alism at its most ru@@ th@@ less re@@ wards psych@@ opath@@ ic behavior -- the lack of empath@@ y, the gli@@ b@@ ness, c@@ un@@ n@@ ing, manipul@@ ativ@@ e."
"@@ (Laughter) ""D@@ oc@@ tor S@@ el@@ ig@@ man, what is the state of psycholog@@ y toda@@ y@@ ?"""
"W@@ e need your perspec@@ tiv@@ es, your curi@@ o@@ sity, your voic@@ es."
"@@ And in Per@@ u, there's a very n@@ ast@@ y busin@@ ess."
"So I make the argument that we re@@ fra@@ me teacher education, that we could focus on con@@ ten@@ t, and that's fin@@ e, and we could focus on the@@ ori@@ es, and that's fin@@ e, but content and theor@@ ies with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing."
You see that enough in the medi@@ a.
"In the end, per@@ ha@@ ps, being human is much more important than being fully in the know."
And here are just a few exam@@ ples.
Th@@ eir names will be en@@ gra@@ ved on the mark@@ ers that hang above us.
What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connec@@ ting people together.
What does that mean for the orig@@ in of fl@@ app@@ ing f@@ ligh@@ t?
"T@@ ens of thousands of dis@@ cre@@ et rul@@ es, 60 steps to sus@@ p@@ end a student from school@@ : It's a form@@ ul@@ a for par@@ al@@ ys@@ is."
"D@@ o we see ar@@ cs in the sky when we look at, say, a cl@@ ust@@ er of galax@@ i@@ es?"
And how has that been for them@@ ? H@@ as it been success@@ ful@@ ?
That's why the $@@ 100 computer will be so important.
"So my thinking here is that we try to motiv@@ ate those kids to start driving home ideas@@ . Let them understand what sustain@@ ability is, and that they have a ves@@ ted interest in it to happen."
It inv@@ aded into his lung@@ s.
There was nothing in a country of 1@@ 40 million people -- no shopping m@@ all@@ s as you know them here.
"So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scal@@ e."
"@@ I am the princip@@ al, and having that title required me to le@@ ad."
"@@ But it's very, very un@@ comfortable for us to actually ac@@ knowledge that we're living in such a world."
So we took a room down@@ sta@@ ir@@ s in the bas@@ ement that had been used as sort of an Ab@@ u G@@ h@@ ra@@ i@@ b an@@ nex@@ .
A@@ re you as good at things as you think you ar@@ e?
"@@ You can be present@@ -@@ h@@ ed@@ on@@ ist@@ ic, nam@@ ely you focus on the jo@@ ys of life, or present@@ -@@ fat@@ alist -- it doesn't matter, your life is control@@ led."
"@@ And so, I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly, it's not expen@@ sive, it can provide immediate benef@@ it@@ s, and it can be quite popul@@ ar."
"W@@ ouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it's effective and safe without having to put patients at risk, because that first time you're never quite su@@ re@@ ?"
So we have to manage many claim@@ s to the same vide@@ o.
"F@@ or any ves@@ sel to come in to fish for a day, we have raised the fe@@ e from -- it was $@@ 6@@ ,000 and $@@ 8@@ ,000@@ , now to $@@ 10@@ ,000@@ , $@@ 12@@ ,000 per ves@@ sel day."
"W@@ e call it a complex system, which it is, but it's also something else."
"@@ I've got to have some action it@@ em@@ s, not just for you but for me."
Where do they go@@ ?
So trust that you're good enough.
""@@ "E@@ very@@ one is broken by life@@ ,"" Ern@@ est Hem@@ ing@@ way once said, ""@@ but some people are stronger in the broken plac@@ es."""
"@@ This is not local popul@@ ation, this is rebel@@ s."
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound@@ ?
(Laughter) Maybe it's called geni@@ us.
"@@ But the world of graphic design, for the most par@@ t, is not."
Th@@ anks very much.
"B@@ y the way, Ton@@ y Ha@@ y@@ war@@ d, the former CE@@ O of B@@ P@@ , had a pla@@ qu@@ e on his des@@ k in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed with this inspi@@ rational slo@@ gan@@ : ""What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail@@ ?"""
It's equally test@@ able.
The neuro@@ log@@ ist@@ 's test is non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve. They both use existing infra@@ struc@@ ture.

"@@ Now, I'm not anti-@@ hospit@@ al."
"In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machin@@ es, have made the atten@@ dance here, Chr@@ is, really quite spar@@ se."
Not yet.
So get out of your head@@ !
"@@ It's not like you just look over and say, ""What am I se@@ ein@@ g@@ ? A no@@ se@@ ? OK@@ ."""
And he wants to take all of that into accoun@@ t.
"@@ You can use app@@ s which are based on this system such as An@@ k@@ i or Mem@@ rise, or you can write li@@ sts of word in a no@@ te@@ book using the Gold@@ list metho@@ d, which is also very popular with many poly@@ glo@@ ts."
"@@ And I told her that after the trans@@ plant, all of the blood flo@@ wing in her v@@ eins would be my bloo@@ d, made from my mar@@ row cells, and that inside the nuc@@ le@@ us of each of those cells is a complete set of my DNA@@ ."
"@@ It's not b@@ ad, but it's very different, and I think that the traditional rules that we have for institutions don't work anymore, and most of us here operate with a different set of princi@@ pl@@ es."
"@@ The demand for this, the need for data to run better programs just within health -- not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries -- is enor@@ mou@@ s."
"@@ And just like any popul@@ ation, most of the people live to be about 70 or 80@@ , but some live to be 90 or 100@@ ."
He learned war like he could read his way home.
"B@@ ecause if you think about it, you're going to have 15@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds, 20@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds flying around this universe."
"@@ And in fact, the first pion@@ e@@ ering treat@@ ments for people as well as do@@ gs, are already becoming avail@@ able."
"@@ I said, ""No, pleas@@ e. We cannot do that."
W@@ ell don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over@@ ; not at all. We are going on.
"M@@ il@@ k stron@@ g@@ ly believed that ti@@ ght kn@@ it neighborhoo@@ ds were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those commun@@ it@@ y@@ ’s most practical problems."
"So C@@ M@@ U allows 32 possible symbol@@ s, but as you can see, there's only a small number that most people are us@@ ing, so we're not actually getting very much streng@@ th from the symbol@@ s in our pass@@ wor@@ ds."
Let me con@@ fir@@ m what she sai@@ d.
They started comp@@ et@@ ing.
"W@@ ell it starts from a very basic pre@@ mis@@ e: of course, there's no Go@@ d."
Dre@@ am with us.
We think we're now at 95 percent accur@@ acy when it comes to dr@@ one stri@@ k@@ es.
"@@ You can see it coming in, and an incredible fl@@ ash of light, and all this c@@ av@@ itation sp@@ reading over the surface of the sn@@ ail@@ ."
Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design@@ ?
"@@ Now, that's still not good enough, and the world does still have pl@@ ent@@ y of problems."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of building pris@@ ons, we could build villages on wheel@@ s."
"@@ They asked them things like, ""@@ During pregn@@ anc@@ y, did you get your full extra ration of a p@@ int of mil@@ k a day@@ ?"""
"In@@ ste@@ ad they were sold on y@@ og@@ ur@@ t, y@@ og@@ ur@@ t being almost as good as bro@@ c@@ co@@ li@@ ."
"W@@ e forget about all of our new middle-@@ class fru@@ stra@@ tions and disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments, and we feel like milli@@ on@@ air@@ es."
"@@ There is no attempt to structure the experience, to make it ut@@ op@@ ian in that sense that we put into it."
"@@ And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of mel@@ od@@ y, and I'll improvis@@ e it."
"@@ And we still use them common@@ ly, because they're very robust and relatively simple devic@@ es."

"@@ But these sur@@ ve@@ ys are cost@@ ly, so they can only be done [@@ in@@ ] thre@@ e@@ - to five-@@ year inter@@ val@@ s."
"@@ And then finally, K@@ ell@@ y's play of brilli@@ ants added to that really some play, I think, of the sky@@ line of H@@ ong Kon@@ g, or perhaps the ch@@ andel@@ ier in the oper@@ a house, or in the theater here, which is the de@@ cor@@ ation, the ic@@ ing on the c@@ ak@@ e, something play@@ ful, something that is just an addition to the architec@@ tural environment, I would say."
"@@ This perspective is a really powerful one for design@@ ers, because you can bring on principles of ec@@ ology, and a really important principle of ec@@ ology is dis@@ per@@ s@@ al, the way organisms move around."
And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remem@@ br@@ ance of the de@@ ad.
"@@ And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infin@@ it@@ ely."
A. And you have an immediate appreci@@ ation that A is going to be more likely to get the thing that's sp@@ reading and to get it so@@ on@@ er by virtu@@ e of their struc@@ tural location within the net@@ work.
And the tap@@ ir has a pre@@ h@@ ens@@ ile pen@@ is.
"@@ And femin@@ ists hat@@ ed us, and the whole thing was w@@ ret@@ ched from beginning to end."
Ob@@ vi@@ ously the Mo@@ del 3 is coming so@@ on.
"O@@ ur own research, now it's 2,000 years later, sugges@@ ts that what's happening is that when the brain is a@@ wake and is at its most bus@@ y, it puts off clear@@ ing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later, and then, when it goes to sleep and doesn't have to be as bus@@ y, it shif@@ ts into a kind of clean@@ ing mo@@ de to clear away the waste from the spaces between its cells, the waste that's accum@@ ul@@ ated throughout the day."
"@@ This video gar@@ ner@@ ed more than a hundred million views in a single week@@ end before Chin@@ a's government, fear@@ ing that it might inc@@ ite some type of social un@@ res@@ t, pulled it from the inter@@ net@@ ."
They don't get their money out.
I believe that a basic income would work like vent@@ ure capital for the people.
And I guess it was part of was finding my own voic@@ e.
It's a remark@@ ably hope@@ ful thing to do.
"@@ And what was remarkable about this day is, by she@@ er co@@ inci@@ den@@ ce, one of the me@@ dev@@ ac medic@@ s happened to have a Go@@ P@@ ro camera on his hel@@ met and cap@@ tured the whole scene on camer@@ a."
"E@@ very single be@@ ad, every single color@@ ed band, represents a weather elem@@ ent that can also be read as a musical no@@ te."
"@@ (Laughter) First up, genetic materi@@ al."
"@@ Now, the human cost of that is obvi@@ ous, once you start to think about it -- the suff@@ er@@ ing, the loss -- it's also, econom@@ ically, enorm@@ ously wa@@ ste@@ ful."
"@@ I know that Je@@ an-@@ Lu@@ c Go@@ dar@@ d was right when he said that, ""@@ A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end, although not necessarily in that order@@ ."""
"B@@ ecause when we looked at the four plat@@ forms around the site, one of which is an up@@ grade of the famili@@ es@@ ' plat@@ form, we knew that these had to be mo@@ ve@@ able to respond to changing condi@@ tions, and the changing definition of what Gro@@ und Zer@@ o is."
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangi@@ ble objec@@ t.
"@@ If we take 10 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of food -- (Laughter) and it results in one kil@@ ogra@@ m of be@@ ef@@ , the other nine kil@@ ogra@@ ms are wa@@ ste, and a lot of that is man@@ ure."
So that report caught my attention in ways that political st@@ un@@ ts could@@ n'@@ t.
(Applause) Now I know definitely which one I would choo@@ se.
"@@ And In@@ dependent Diplom@@ at, today, tries to in@@ corpor@@ ate some of the things I learned at ?@@ What I@@ f@@ !@@ ."
"@@ I simply said, ""If Haw@@ ken is right and business and industry must lea@@ d, who will lead business and industr@@ y?"
"@@ You can see the red hair@@ , and I don't know if you can see the no@@ se ring there."
What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program@@ ?
(Applause) Indi@@ a's not uniqu@@ e.
So this is where this factors in.
"@@ (Applause) Bl@@ ur@@ b on the next book, right?"
But it so happened he was speaking in a Pro@@ test@@ ant Ch@@ ur@@ ch.
How were paper bir@@ ch and Dou@@ gl@@ as f@@ ir communic@@ at@@ ing?
"@@ (Laughter) And as they whi@@ z by you, it's like being passed by a little iron R@@ ais@@ in@@ et going up the h@@ ill@@ ."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done, we've done it with paint and temporary materi@@ als."
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-@@ water.
"So we started to think@@ : Is this the ag@@ ent that might have been present in the sk@@ ier, and might have she had more of it than someone else, and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died, as we found out with our wor@@ m experiment@@ s?"
"@@ It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the custom@@ er, they're the produc@@ t."
(Laughter) This has spread all over the world.
And he found that something weird was going on.
"W@@ e might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is har@@ ming us all."
"@@ I think East and Wes@@ t, we are losing multi@@ p@@ lic@@ ity, both within our societies and within ourselv@@ es."
The media was caught in this vi@@ ci@@ ous cycle of opin@@ ion and out@@ burst and no outcome what@@ so@@ ever@@ .
"@@ And if you loo@@ k, for example, in the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce, they talk about nature and nat@@ ure@@ 's Go@@ d."
"@@ I got a D in po@@ tter@@ y, which was the one thing that I did get -- which was use@@ ful, obvi@@ ously."
"@@ Y@@ es, compassion -- literally, as we learned y@@ ester@@ day -- suffering together."
It's the de@@ pen@@ dence on farm sub@@ si@@ dies and under@@ -@@ performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban@@ .
"@@ I have a short test you can take to figure out if you're more of a gi@@ ver or a tak@@ er, and you can take it right now."
"@@ Now, how about the second question: How should we liv@@ e?"
You hit the soli@@ d rock@@ .
Let's have a look at some of the characterist@@ ics of this system.
"@@ You end up isol@@ ated if you don't cul@@ tiv@@ ate the capacity for soli@@ tu@@ de, the ability to be separ@@ ate, to gather your@@ self."
"@@ And right now, our bas@@ ket@@ ball team is the best in the le@@ agu@@ e."
"@@ And the lines represent -- the do@@ ts are the people, and the lines represent friend@@ ship relationship@@ s."
"So for instance, in Con@@ go, because of how they are soci@@ alized and train@@ ed, United N@@ ations offici@@ als, don@@ ors, diplom@@ at@@ s, the st@@ af@@ f of most non@@ govern@@ mental organiz@@ ations, they interpre@@ t continued fighting and mass@@ ac@@ r@@ es as a top@@ -@@ down problem."
"So really, a big part of our processes was creating a ligh@@ ting environment for every single location that Benjam@@ in had to appear so that we could put Ben@@ 's head into any scene and it would exactly match the ligh@@ ting that's on the other ac@@ tors in the real world."
"@@ And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great@@ ."
"O@@ ver 17 days at the Olymp@@ ics, 7@@ ,000 vis@@ it@@ ors from all over the world actually got to individu@@ ally control the light from the C@@ N To@@ wer, par@@ li@@ ament and Ni@@ ag@@ ara in real time with their minds from across the country, 3@@ ,000 km away."
Now this image const@@ it@@ utes a huge amount of work.
So I went and designed fra@@ me by fra@@ me to try to make this robot as gra@@ ce@@ ful and eng@@ aging as possible.
This is the first voice they've created for an individu@@ al.
And it really was a place where I learned to wal@@ k.
It's just your ideas that coun@@ t.
So we need to find innovative ways of sol@@ ving some of these problems that we fac@@ e.
You deci@@ de: how much of your heart do you want to protec@@ t?
"O@@ n J@@ uly 4, 201@@ 3, my world came crash@@ ing in on me."
"In@@ ste@@ ad of having to put infin@@ itely many col@@ ors in your TV set to sim@@ ulate the real world, TV manufactur@@ ers only have to put thre@@ e: red, gre@@ en, and blu@@ e, which is lucky for them, re@@ ally."
"B@@ ecause we're taking this data in 3D form, s@@ lic@@ ing it up before it gets past the mach@@ ine, we can actually create structures that are more in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate than any other manufacturing technology -- or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way."
"@@ And then, when they wander@@ ed just outside the bor@@ der, two of their adults were kil@@ led, including the mother, which we sometimes call the alpha fem@@ al@@ e."
(Laughter) This is very promis@@ ing.
Hu@@ h@@ ?
And we built up a series of tools like this.
"@@ Ho@@ wever, many of these are star@@ ved for capital to exp@@ and, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necess@@ ary. No@@ body thinks in terms of a mark@@ et."
So models can change.
"W@@ e dep@@ end on water, forest@@ s, deser@@ ts, oce@@ ans."
"@@ Now, you either have a feeling -- you feel more secure than you are, there's a false sense of secur@@ ity."
"@@ The profession@@ als never come near us, except in that case of Sy@@ l@@ via Bro@@ w@@ ne that I told you about a moment ago."
"@@ It's been really quite a roll@@ er co@@ aster experience, but going back to that first question that we asked, is it replic@@ able@@ ? Yeah. It most certainly is replic@@ able."
It's fit@@ ted with soli@@ d electro@@ des and an electro@@ ly@@ te that's a solution of s@@ alt and water.
"E@@ D: All right@@ .@@ T@@ B: Okay. Tur@@ n it a little bit inside, a little bit toward the middle for me."
"So to our blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ t, we sp@@ lit some hair@@ s."
But the wealth gap@@ s are growing wider@@ .
So there's so much from this.

"So when the British Museum and T@@ ehr@@ an National Mus@@ u@@ em cooper@@ ate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iran@@ ians ask for one thing only as a lo@@ an."

"W@@ h@@ enever you work on that level, things be@@ have different."
S@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding this structure are several other organs that together make up the whole ur@@ in@@ ary system.
"W@@ hen these heart@@ breaking images of oil@@ ed birds finally began to emer@@ ge from the G@@ ul@@ f of Mexic@@ o last year during the horri@@ fic B@@ P oil sp@@ ill, a German biolog@@ ist by the name of Sil@@ via G@@ aus was quo@@ ted as saying, ""We should just eu@@ than@@ ize all oil@@ ed bir@@ ds, because studies have shown that fe@@ wer than one percent of them survive after being releas@@ ed."""

This is an exciting new vent@@ ure.
"@@ Here's another American design that came out of Los Al@@ am@@ os, and is now commer@@ ci@@ al."
I've never met a gener@@ ation.
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conduc@@ ting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is b@@ ad.
So I thought I'd better look it up first.
"@@ These clou@@ ds are bom@@ bing along, but from all the way down here, they appear to be moving gra@@ ce@@ fully, slow@@ ly, like most clou@@ ds."
"@@ You bring in, say, six objec@@ ts, and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least lik@@ ed."
"(@@ S@@ igh@@ s) ""D@@ on't ever argue with the Dev@@ il."
"@@ I'm making this claim that there's a game layer on top of the world, and it's very important that we build it proper@@ ly."
"E@@ x@@ c@@ ept for the threat of bio@@ -@@ terror@@ ism, they're very simple issues in terms of, can we design things to produce clean energy, perhaps revolution@@ izing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple process@@ es."
And so I come to my wis@@ h.
"@@ I see her, and she seems to see me."
"In this room, right now, we've probably record@@ ed more than almost all of human pre-@@ ancient history."
"@@ And we can wra@@ p our head@@ s around the sp@@ ill@@ s, because that's what we see here, but in fact, these guys actually live in a war z@@ one."
Is it a place where you can finally sur@@ ren@@ der and not have to take responsibility for every@@ thing@@ ?

"@@ And here we d@@ ein@@ nerv@@ ate, or cut the ner@@ ve away, just from little se@@ g@@ ments of mus@@ cle and leave others alone that give us our up@@ -@@ down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close sign@@ al."

"M@@ et@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others, how we communic@@ ate, lear@@ n, discover and inv@@ ent."

"@@ But today I worry about, what if all we do is sell more cars and tru@@ ck@@ s?"
Sci@@ enti@@ sts are totally st@@ y@@ mi@@ ed at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it un@@ locked so we can tackle those huge problem@@ s.
"W@@ ell, an explan@@ ation is an ass@@ er@@ tion about what's there, un@@ se@@ en, that accoun@@ ts for what's se@@ en; because the explan@@ atory role of Per@@ se@@ ph@@ one's marri@@ age contra@@ ct could be played equally well by infin@@ itely many other ad ho@@ c enti@@ ties."

"@@ And I believe that our cities today have severe fl@@ aw@@ s, and that different, better ones could be buil@@ t."

"In my work over the years, I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to di@@ e."

It's just easier to think of yourself as having it all figured out.
"W@@ K: In fact, a design of the wind@@ m@@ ill that was in the book, it has got four -- ah -- three bl@@ ad@@ es, and mine has got four bl@@ ad@@ es."

(Laughter) But I think there's going to be huge impac@@ ts.
"@@ They came up with ""@@ Lo@@ ve-@@ Cra@@ zed Imm@@ ig@@ rant K@@ ill@@ s Sen@@ ator@@ 's D@@ augh@@ ter@@ ."""
"So after this piece was ma@@ de, the de@@ an of the cin@@ ema school at US@@ C@@ , the University of Sou@@ thern Californi@@ a, brought in the head of the World E@@ con@@ om@@ ic For@@ um to try ""H@@ ung@@ er@@ ,"" and he took off the go@@ g@@ gl@@ es, and he commis@@ sion@@ ed a piece about Sy@@ ri@@ a on the spo@@ t."
And so here's what we've cre@@ ated.
The book starts like this. This is the cover@@ .
Your plant can blo@@ w up.
You just had to do things some@@ tim@@ es.
"F@@ ive years ago, Gen X@@ ers spent 20@@ .@@ 7 hours online and TV@@ , the majority on TV@@ ."
"@@ And that night, all 90 kids -- dr@@ essed appropri@@ ately, doing their job, own@@ ing it."
"An@@ yway, we had a major cultural issu@@ e."
So the low-@@ tech version looks like this.
"@@ The next issue that resol@@ ved was that, if 90 percent of head and ne@@ ck pain is caused by im@@ bal@@ ance, the other 10 percent, largely -- if you set aside an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s, brain cancer and hormon@@ al issues -- is the circul@@ ation."
"S@@ o, I don't know what the name of this thing is."
"@@ I could not place it, and it bu@@ g@@ ged me, and then in the coming week or two, I would just be watching an old movi@@ e, and this would happen."
And here is Pro@@ ch@@ l@@ or@@ o@@ cocc@@ us.
"S@@ o, we line them all up so they go together around the meaning@@ ful poin@@ ts, integr@@ ated across everything we know about the pati@@ ent."
When everybody else was dro@@ pping out.
But they wouldn't give me an answer@@ .
"@@ (Laughter) C@@ lear@@ ly, athlet@@ es have gotten more sav@@ v@@ y about performan@@ ce-@@ enh@@ anc@@ ing drugs as well, and that's made a difference in some sports at some times, but technology has made a difference in all sport@@ s, from faster sk@@ is to ligh@@ ter sho@@ es."
Here's some faces on the side of a rock@@ .
"S@@ o, who am I@@ ?"
"@@ There are other sources of income for arti@@ sts, ho@@ we@@ ver."
And now they were forced to release the ultim@@ ate list of everything that's in Cor@@ ex@@ it.
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there.
"@@ Now, different people's world@@ views can be drama@@ tically different."
"@@ You know, fight for that, because that is what is going to change this world and that is what defin@@ es us."
"@@ I actually described the algorith@@ m, which is similar to something called a hier@@ arch@@ ical hidden Mar@@ ko@@ v model, something I've worked on since the '@@ 90@@ s."
I dis@@ avo@@ wed the truth by convin@@ cing myself it was sex and not ra@@ pe.
"@@ And among all this bio@@ diversity that they had never seen before, they found one species that caught their attention very quickly."
I thought maybe the mirror box was g@@ one.
"@@ I mean, I wish I had a so@@ fter voice maybe, but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day."
"In the end, it was one of the top downlo@@ ads on a whole bunch of music stream@@ ing servic@@ es."
"W@@ e have tar paper on the ro@@ of@@ to@@ ps that bo@@ un@@ ces heat back into the atmosp@@ here, contribut@@ ing to global climate change, no dou@@ b@@ t."
"@@ This isn't a design, OK?"
W@@ ell -- (Laughter) -- I hadn't thought of that one.
My mission was always to create great public spac@@ es.
"S@@ ome@@ thing, again, that went back to something more fundament@@ al."
"@@ The next is self-@@ assem@@ bl@@ y, because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this proc@@ ess."
It must have been a very unusual day for him.
(Laughter) That's ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous.
There are four countries around the boar@@ d.
There is wonderful inspi@@ ration coming from the area it@@ self.
"@@ He@@ ’s a computer scienti@@ st, Reg@@ in@@ ald Adam@@ s a psycholog@@ ist, and there I am, and we’re putting this together into a book@@ ."
"@@ You're in these levels of inf@@ eri@@ or visual cortex@@ , where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of ima@@ ges, or fig@@ ments or frag@@ ment@@ ary fig@@ ments, all neur@@ ally en@@ co@@ ded in particular cells or small cl@@ ust@@ ers of cells."
"@@ The ch@@ im@@ p is going to see, watch care@@ fully, they're going to see 200 milli@@ secon@@ d@@ s' ex@@ pos@@ ure — that's fast@@ , that's eight movie fra@@ mes — of numbers one, two, three, four@@ , fi@@ ve."
"W@@ ell, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example."
"@@ And here you can see this paras@@ ite in ac@@ tion, like in an ac@@ rob@@ atic man@@ eu@@ ver."
Why did he buy this book@@ ?
"@@ (Laughter) This poor guy said, ""My daily life until reti@@ re@@ ment or dea@@ th, s@@ igh@@ ."""
"@@ And just being able to visit different places and go through different times, we have data from 19@@ 50 to 20@@ 50@@ ."
(Laughter) OK.
"@@ But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- (Laughter) (Applause) But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who flo@@ ats like a but@@ ter@@ fly and st@@ ings like a be@@ e, has Parkinson@@ 's and sha@@ kes just like me, Mu@@ ha@@ mma@@ d Ali@@ ."
S@@ her@@ man's up in shark heav@@ en.
"@@ And if there were no animals in those spac@@ es, what does that tell us about, you know, how evolution works on land@@ ?"
"So I put together a No@@ -F@@ ace cost@@ ume, and I wore it on the floor at Comic@@ -@@ Con@@ ."
"@@ The last thing that I would like to sa@@ y: When I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non@@ le@@ th@@ al weap@@ on would look like, they almost inevit@@ ably say the same thing."
"@@ I work with a lot of musici@@ ans from around the world, and often we don't have any common language at all, but we sit down behind our instrum@@ ents, and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emo@@ te."
"K@@ K@@ M: So on May 5, 201@@ 4, just about three months after meeting online, we were married on the steps of City H@@ all in Manhat@@ t@@ an, and it was beautiful in every conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able way."
Africa was truly fascinating for me.
"@@ Par@@ tic@@ ul@@ arly in the world of sea ice, the rate of natural change is out@@ stri@@ pping predic@@ tions of just a few years ago, and the processes either are acceler@@ ating or the predic@@ tions were too low to begin with."
"W@@ hy is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half ful@@ l, and somebody literally sees it as half emp@@ ty@@ ?"
"@@ And what bar@@ co@@ ding does is use a specific gene called CO@@ 1 that's consistent within a species, but v@@ aries among speci@@ es."
"W@@ e can actually use this to contain out@@ break@@ s of mosqu@@ it@@ o-@@ born diseas@@ es, of epide@@ mic@@ s, right?"
It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Ph@@ illi@@ ps next year in New Yor@@ k.
"P@@ lease come for the sho@@ w@@ ."""
And let's take a ste@@ war@@ ding role for the sound around us.
This is a nin@@ e-@@ year-old girl n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating to princip@@ ally children's sit@@ es.
"@@ And so the community on C@@ ap@@ e C@@ od here in Pro@@ vin@@ c@@ et@@ own was ri@@ pe for citi@@ zen science, people looking for ways to get involved and to help@@ ."
"@@ And the first time around, I saw these tom@@ b@@ st@@ ones and these wonderful people who@@ 'd done great things and I thought, what do I want to be remember@@ ed for@@ ?"
"@@ And so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bo@@ go@@ ta, one of the three children brought her mo@@ ther."
We@@ 've got to clear the ar@@ ter@@ ies of our lives.
But here's the thing: we are the vo@@ ters.
"@@ But then, of course, everyone is driving the brid@@ ge."
"Un@@ fortunately, it turned out, that many of these trials were with@@ hel@@ d."
I think we can all agree that it's worth the trouble to do so.
"E@@ very Janu@@ ary, we go to the American Di@@ al@@ ect So@@ ci@@ ety ann@@ ual meet@@ ing, where among other things, we vote on the word of the year."
"@@ And the final thing is that there is a very ti@@ ght cou@@ pl@@ ing between the reg@@ ulation of our body within the brain and the body itself, unlike any other cou@@ pl@@ ing."
"@@ (Laughter) So ""S@@ ear@@ ch In@@ side Y@@ our@@ self@@ "" -- how does it work@@ ?"
And then over to the e@@ ast we have the L@@ ine Is@@ land@@ s.
"In my career I've had two ex@@ po@@ sur@@ es to radi@@ ation, which is two too many, because it stays with you for life."
"E@@ ven the prin@@ ting pres@@ s, even the prin@@ ting press was assum@@ ed to be a tool that was going to en@@ force Ca@@ tho@@ lic intellectual he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y across Europe."
"@@ This case, they are not pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ing in the U@@ K@@ ."
"@@ The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it care@@ ful@@ ly."
"M@@ o@@ st of us worry about things we can't contro@@ l, like war, terror@@ ism, the tra@@ gic earthqu@@ ake that just occur@@ red in Ha@@ iti@@ ."
"@@ You bi@@ ke across the state, you walk up and down the ri@@ ver."
"@@ It's a movement that -- it ad@@ voc@@ ates making bio@@ technology accessi@@ ble to every@@ one, not just scientists and people in government lab@@ s."
"@@ But I don't want my don@@ ation spent on adver@@ tis@@ ing, I want it go to the need@@ y."""
"In fact, one can witn@@ ess the presence of the ri@@ ver@@ 's exten@@ sive water network all throughout the city, in places such as private and public f@@ oun@@ tain@@ s."
We're at a billi@@ on.
"@@ And I said, ""W@@ ell I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Sec@@ ret@@ ary of State for a few minut@@ es."""
"@@ And in many ways, hack@@ ing is what built Americ@@ a."
F@@ ans want that experienc@@ e.
"@@ And that's what I think the magic ingredi@@ ent is, the secret sau@@ ce, is can you in@@ vo@@ ke wonder@@ ."
H@@ e's at home having te@@ a.
"@@ And as he's lea@@ ving, he sees a bird making a n@@ est on a c@@ lif@@ f le@@ d@@ ge."
So you can use this information to understand you in a respon@@ sive loo@@ p.
"W@@ ishing you could reach out, to connec@@ t, to com@@ fort, to partici@@ pat@@ e."
"@@ You know if you are in an air@@ craft at 30@@ ,000 feet and the c@@ ab@@ in de@@ press@@ ur@@ iz@@ es, you can have oxy@@ gen@@ ."
But heavy arti@@ ll@@ ery is nothing new in terrorist oper@@ ations.
"@@ And the journey that I want to take you on, we need to start by going back in time."
"D@@ H: Exc@@ use me, could we work on the design of the micro@@ phon@@ e?"
And eventually you get to places where it is form@@ id@@ able and dangerous and un@@ fortun@@ ately sli@@ des just don't do just@@ ic@@ e.
So what if we take a look at the last American pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tion map through the hel@@ met@@ ?
"@@ But notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of gen@@ oci@@ de or the war@@ s, it's everyday viol@@ ence."
"@@ There was a study invol@@ ving a play@@ ground fire pol@@ e, iron@@ ically, in which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be war@@ ned by both their mom@@ s and da@@ ds about the fire pol@@ e's risk, and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pol@@ e, a parent was very likely to ass@@ ist her."
"N@@ in@@ th Man: You see, family is ... it's aw@@ ful."
This lo@@ vely cre@@ ature is an Asi@@ an cock@@ ro@@ ach@@ .
"@@ And so that could be -@@ -- (Applause) that could be potentially a good alternative to solar power@@ ed re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated cam@@ el@@ s. (Laughter) And of course, there's no use in stor@@ age if you can't use [@@ it@@ ]@@ ."

W@@ as@@ n't she amaz@@ ing? Mur@@ iel C@@ ooper@@ . She was w@@ ack@@ y.
"@@ It's full of us, it's full of our stuff, full of our wa@@ ste, full of our demand@@ s."
"@@ And so early on in the process, as it started to really eat away at me, I deci@@ ded, you know what, can I find another way to get people to don@@ ate their brains to this research@@ ?"
"@@ And in fact, shipping has a role to play here, because shipping noise has contri@@ buted to damag@@ ing the acou@@ stic habit@@ ats of ocean creatur@@ es."
"CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there about ending this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ dn@@ ess."
"@@ (Laughter) And Mah@@ mou@@ d, ""O@@ f course I can@@ ."
"P@@ op@@ ulation times consum@@ ption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet, and right now, it's a simple ""@@ not equal@@ ."""
"@@ And on Sun@@ day morning the neighbor@@ s lea@@ f blo@@ wer comes out, and I want to thro@@ t@@ tle them."
"@@ This can be a big de@@ al, especially when it comes to life-@@ and-@@ death situ@@ ations."
"A@@ s punish@@ ment, Da@@ ed@@ al@@ us was ban@@ ished from Ath@@ ens and made his way to Cre@@ te."
I know them well.
"In 201@@ 1, the Li@@ by@@ an revolution broke out, and my family was on the front lin@@ es."
"@@ But after three tri@@ ps to Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a, I decided that it might be nic@@ er to work in war@@ mer water."
The nit@@ ro@@ gen has two problem@@ s.
"In due course, Britain started using oil and gas from the North Se@@ a, and in the year 2000, oil and gas production from the North Se@@ a also pe@@ ak@@ ed, and they're now on the de@@ clin@@ e."
And every day we have a choic@@ e.
"@@ If we look clos@@ er, we see those pe@@ aks occ@@ ur at the same month every year."
"@@ And while this Hir@@ sh@@ hor@@ n is not land@@ mark@@ ed, it's very, very histor@@ ically sensi@@ tive."
And that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.
"@@ It's one metaph@@ or re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data."
"@@ And because it has two different co@@ effici@@ ents of expan@@ sion, when he@@ ated, one side will exp@@ and faster than the other and result in a cur@@ ling action."
"@@ And thir@@ d, you want to change your relationship with ideas."
"@@ And then writ@@ ing, that's what happens. I get these hin@@ ts, these clu@@ es, and I realize that they've been obvi@@ ous, and yet they have not be@@ en."
"@@ And mean@@ while, I use non@@ sense, as you can see."
I@@ t@@ ’s basically the same thing as the 30 cir@@ cles thing that I just had you do.
So that's precis@@ ely what I'm setting out to do.
"@@ But with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic comm@@ and@@ ments, you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live."
"So there's lessons to lear@@ n, and there's lessons to learn from the excep@@ tion, the excep@@ tion that we know very well today from the discover@@ ies we've ma@@ de, and many other schol@@ ars have made around the world."
"O@@ n the right, ancient Go@@ th@@ ic, cut in the resistant material of steel by hand."
What we're doing is we are sei@@ zing control of our evolutionary future.
"@@ I'm not sugges@@ ting that we turn away from our devic@@ es, just that we develop a more self-@@ aware relationship with them, with each other and with ourselv@@ es."
"So Facebook is not the only place you can do this, but it's the big@@ ges@@ t, and it ser@@ ves to illustr@@ ate the number@@ s."

"In fact, in my office in 1990@@ , I had 18 miles of ta@@ pe."
