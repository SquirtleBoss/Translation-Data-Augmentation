There is a difference with in@@ com@@ e.
"@@ Religion has not being separ@@ ated from any other areas of life, and in particular, what's cru@@ cial to understand about this world is that it's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what R@@ attra@@ y is going to call religi@@ on, because if they want an explan@@ ation of something, if they want to know why the cro@@ p just fai@@ led, if they want to know why it's ra@@ ining or not rain@@ ing, if they need ra@@ in, if they want to know why their grand@@ father has died, they are going to appe@@ al to the very same enti@@ ties, the very same language, talk to the very same go@@ ds about that."

"@@ And I'm sure those architec@@ ts are inspi@@ red, as I am, by what surro@@ unds us, by nature."

"@@ And the exhau@@ st@@ ion of mothers who had taken two, three, sometimes four bus@@ es to bring their child to the doctor was just pal@@ p@@ able."
I cannot will myself to be passionate at 7@@ 1.

Let me tell you a little story from my own negoti@@ ating experienc@@ e.

"@@ And nobody has to remind you to o@@ be@@ y a law of nature, right?"
"@@ I mean, everyone did."
"@@ C@@ ros@@ s-@@ talk in the brain is the rul@@ e, not the excep@@ tion."
"@@ I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the oce@@ an, and this couldn't be a better place to talk about the really, really important effect of my work."

"@@ Now this may seem a bit ambi@@ ti@@ ous, but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands, you realize that you're ali@@ ve."
And it's not unique to us.
That means we are cat@@ ching this cancer over a hundred days earlier than traditional metho@@ ds.
"W@@ here these ar@@ ter@@ ies come to the surfac@@ e, these ear@@ th ar@@ ter@@ ies, we'll get ge@@ other@@ mal manif@@ es@@ ta@@ tion@@ s: f@@ um@@ ar@@ ol@@ es, hot spr@@ ings and in our case, the bo@@ iling ri@@ ver."
"@@ It is a lot more sophistic@@ ated than a micro@@ wave o@@ ven, but it basically is bo@@ iling the water molecules in the very surface level of your sk@@ in."
I did a show in London last year made out of i@@ Po@@ ds -- I used i@@ Po@@ ds as a materi@@ al.

"@@ A typical cul@@ t requires a high level of commit@@ ment from its members and main@@ tains a stri@@ ct hier@@ arch@@ y, separ@@ ating uns@@ us@@ pec@@ ting suppor@@ ters and rec@@ ru@@ its from the inner work@@ ings."

So that star is also 50 million light years a@@ way.
"@@ You see, I teach entrepreneur@@ ship, and we all know that most new vent@@ ures fa@@ il, and innov@@ ators and entrepreneur@@ s need all the luck they can get@@ ."

And this is a col@@ os@@ sal mistak@@ e.
"@@ And we came up with this idea of issu@@ ing bon@@ ds, press freedom bon@@ ds."
"W@@ hen I came to this company one year ago, I thought to myself, this company has anti-@@ discrimin@@ ation policies that protect ga@@ y, les@@ bi@@ an, bis@@ ex@@ ual and trans@@ gender people."
"So we experim@@ ented with tiny atom@@ ized water particles to create a dr@@ y m@@ ist that is shaped by the wind and in test@@ ing, discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting w@@ et."
The aw@@ k@@ ward reality is we're not making fast enough progr@@ ess.
And all of these bl@@ ank areas are the areas in which the wir@@ es are running through@@ .
I think it's times 100 or something like that.

"E@@ vent@@ u@@ ally, you can sort of roughly see that there's sort of a diam@@ ond shape over@@ all, and when it's fully done, it'll look like a giant diam@@ on@@ d, or that's the idea behind it, and it's al@@ ign@@ ed on true nor@@ th."
A@@ re you ready to go@@ ? OK.
"@@ If you've had a friend who's died of AID@@ S, then you hate HIV@@ ."

"M@@ ig@@ r@@ ating e@@ ast@@ war@@ d, following the grass@@ land@@ s, because that's what they were adap@@ ted to live on."

"@@ And while certain sign@@ s sp@@ an thousands of kilomet@@ ers, other sign@@ s had much more restri@@ c@@ ted distribu@@ tion pattern@@ s, with some being limited to a single ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y, like we see here with these divided rec@@ t@@ ang@@ les that are only found in nor@@ thern Spa@@ in, and which some researchers have spec@@ ul@@ ated could be some sort of family or cl@@ an sign@@ s."
"A@@ s a mag@@ ici@@ an, I try to create images that make people stop and think@@ ."
It ga@@ ined credi@@ bility from both the Le@@ ban@@ ese and the international commun@@ ity.
And so what I decided to do.
""@@ "J@@ ust a one-@@ ey@@ ed mon@@ ke@@ y,"" said the Bra@@ h@@ min@@ ."
They are just going alon@@ e@@ ! (Applause) And many times I get the impres@@ sion that they are not really even interested in hearing from African@@ s who might know.

"@@ (Laughter) ""I love how I feel toda@@ y."""
"B@@ ecause not many people are really going to read Arch@@ im@@ e@@ des in ancient Gre@@ ek, but they should have the chance to do it."
"@@ This is B@@ ir@@ h@@ an, who was the E@@ thiop@@ ian girl who launched Li@@ ve A@@ id in the 1980@@ s, 15 minutes away from death when she was res@@ cu@@ ed, and that picture of her being res@@ cu@@ ed is one that went round the world."
Evolution in Middle World has not equi@@ pped us to handle very impro@@ b@@ able event@@ s; we don't live long enough.
L@@ ater they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me form@@ ally.
Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her bre@@ ast@@ s.
So back to my original question.
"@@ Is there some kind of natural ill@@ ust@@ ration, some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people's imagin@@ ation her@@ e?"""
"So I think one of the reasons people are dist@@ ur@@ bed by destro@@ ying books, people don't want to ri@@ p books and nobody really wants to throw away a book, is that we think about books as living things, we think about them as a body, and they're created to relate to our body, as far as scale, but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things."
"@@ It's possible to start already now, it's just too danger@@ ous."
This is what it looks like under my des@@ k.
Here's a ba@@ yon@@ et@@ te from the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l War@@ .
One fact is not true.
It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identif@@ ier for the new social group that they've ha@@ d.
"A@@ re they posi@@ tively cor@@ rel@@ ated, giving money makes you happ@@ y?"
"@@ It en@@ ables you to see the world in a new way, through someone else@@ 's ey@@ es."
Je@@ e gets to have his projec@@ t; the public gets a swe@@ eter environ@@ ment@@ ; and different public gets a place to express it@@ self@@ ; and the adver@@ tis@@ ers finally get somebody to look at their ad@@ s.
Th@@ ose fol@@ ds fold into a bas@@ e. You shape the bas@@ e.
R@@ a@@ ise your hand@@ s.
"@@ I moved back to New York, my work has change@@ d."
It's always ren@@ e@@ wing and re@@ fres@@ hing it@@ self.
"B@@ ecause the sun@@ sh@@ ine kid was b@@ right, with a warm person@@ ality, And inside he bur@@ ned sav@@ ag@@ ely H@@ ur@@ t by the words and cur@@ ses of the shado@@ w@@ y fol@@ k who spoke hol@@ es in his soul and left ca@@ vi@@ ties, And as his heart har@@ den@@ ed, his spar@@ k dar@@ ken@@ ed, E@@ very time they called him names it cool@@ ed his fl@@ am@@ es, He thought they might like him if he kept his light di@@ m But they were bus@@ y telling ligh@@ tn@@ ing she had terrible a@@ im@@ , He could@@ n’t quite get to gri@@ ps with what they said, So he let his light be ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed by what they said, He fell into a L@@ one Star State like Texas, And felt like he@@ ’@@ d been pun@@ ched in his solar plex@@ us."
And so the problem with having 9@@ 00 of something is that you have to do every step 9@@ 00 tim@@ es.
"W@@ hen I was 22 years old, I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stor@@ ies."

"B@@ ecause of doc@@ tor@@ -@@ patient privi@@ leg@@ e, they couldn't really tell us what was going on."
"@@ But of course, that only works when we have both of these compon@@ ents."
"@@ The other 90 percent take refu@@ ge in sil@@ ence -- half of them, because the inci@@ dent involves a close family member or someone they know, and that makes it much more difficult to deal with and talk about."
"In India, nobody really talks about works of ar@@ t; they always talk about the appreci@@ ation of ar@@ t."

"@@ But it makes the point all the more, of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is."

But it's also about producing a language to describe this.

"@@ It teach@@ es kids to re-@@ vision their commun@@ ities, so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this."
"@@ They see around cor@@ ner@@ s, shap@@ ing their future, not just reac@@ ting to it."
Not a good idea at all.
"W@@ e are looking at the emergen@@ ce of a car 2.@@ 0 -- a whole new mark@@ et, a whole new business model@@ ."
It was in actually a din@@ er outside of D@@ all@@ as@@ /@@ F@@ ort Wor@@ th A@@ ir@@ por@@ t.
I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history.
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay Galax@@ y.
Have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loo@@ se so@@ ck s@@ mus@@ hed up against your th@@ igh@@ ?
And I'm inten@@ sely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.
So we started with a question: Do they love us?
"@@ Pla@@ y it well, and your days will be mostly jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ."""
"@@ And if there is anything that I can do, if I can do anything to make you do the things you don't want to do, so you can have what you want, I will do it."
"So the only thing I can think of is say, ""L@@ ist@@ en. Let me tell you a story."
And we all think our kids will be especially tal@@ ent@@ ed.
I love Don@@ na Mar@@ tin@@ .
"@@ And that's the deep se@@ a, that's the environment that we consider to be among the most pri@@ st@@ ine left on Earth."
And I'm incredibly proud of that.
We see light reflec@@ ted off the Mo@@ on.
"W@@ e would use conven@@ tional metho@@ d@@ s; I have a cros@@ s@@ bo@@ w -- you see it in my hand there, which we use to sample wh@@ ales and dolph@@ ins for genetic studies as well."
I think we need to allow challeng@@ ing.
"@@ (Laughter) So, there's a kind of British under@@ stat@@ ement, mur@@ der-@@ myster@@ y theme that I really love very much."
So this ep@@ iso@@ de launched a lif@@ el@@ ong qu@@ est for my identi@@ ty.
"@@ Y@@ es, it's the first sent@@ ence of Fran@@ z K@@ af@@ ka@@ 's ""The Met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ s@@ is@@ ."""
So it re-@@ shows the brain makes predic@@ tions and fundamentally changes the pre@@ c@@ ep@@ ts.
"So Mel@@ cher Medi@@ a's te@@ am, who's on the East co@@ ast -- and we're on the West co@@ ast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, dra@@ gs in images and tex@@ t."
I think he knew what the scar@@ s on his face would say to the rest of the world.
"@@ There's nothing like it in the land@@ ."""
And it@@ ’s not just lung cancer.
"@@ And one thing you need to know about drag@@ on@@ fli@@ es, one important thing, is that they lay their eg@@ gs in fresh water."
"W@@ e don't need to inv@@ ent solutions because we have them -- cas@@ h flow lo@@ ans based in income rather than ass@@ ets, lo@@ ans that use secure contrac@@ ts rather than coll@@ ater@@ al, because women often don't own land@@ ."
"@@ He said it was his profi@@ le. ""@@ Th@@ en what are you@@ ?"" I ask@@ ed. ""A@@ n ac@@ tor@@ ,"" he sai@@ d."
So how many of you are sort of making your@@ selves sm@@ aller@@ ?
"@@ (Applause) If you, as a matter of fact, put four mar@@ bles inside, you sim@@ ulate the molecular structure of me@@ than@@ e, C@@ H@@ 4@@ ."
"@@ They're feeding our children every single day, and before a child can lear@@ n, their bell@@ y needs to be ful@@ l, and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educ@@ ated society."
"A@@ fter all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorro@@ w."
"T@@ hat's right@@ ; in just a few minutes, a pattern invol@@ ving millions of neurons is being tel@@ ep@@ or@@ ted into 1,@@ 200 mind@@ s, just by people listening to a voice and watching a face."
But let's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the day@@ time.
"So I typ@@ ed up a bud@@ get, a materials li@@ st, a tim@@ el@@ ine, and a proced@@ ure, and I email@@ ed it to 200 different prof@@ ess@@ ors at John@@ s H@@ op@@ k@@ ins University and the National Inst@@ it@@ utes of Health -- essenti@@ ally, anyone that had anything to do with pan@@ cre@@ atic cancer@@ ."
"W@@ hen life brought about a series of death and near@@ -@@ death experiences within my close cir@@ cl@@ e, which high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for an emergen@@ cy medical response service in India, similar to 9@@ 11 in USA@@ ."
And B@@ -@@ re@@ x was found under a thousand cu@@ bi@@ c y@@ ards of rock@@ .
And they're rus@@ hing around all str@@ essed out.
Because I think it's an ur@@ gen@@ t question.
"@@ And she@@ 'd say, ""I'm not talk@@ ing."""
"@@ He was working for the US government, and one of the ideas that he put for@@ th was, ""W@@ ow, humans are creating so much information, and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read or the connec@@ tions between important ideas@@ ."""
"@@ And although we don't yet have an Ara@@ b Kin@@ se@@ y Rep@@ ort to tell us exactly what's happening inside bedro@@ om@@ s across the Ara@@ b regi@@ on, It's pretty clear that something is not right."
"@@ It happened again about 120 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some so@@ lit@@ ary was@@ ps began creating little simple, primi@@ tive n@@ est@@ s, or hi@@ v@@ es."
"""@@ I found these st@@ amp@@ s as a child, and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to."
"@@ And so fundament@@ ally, rather th@@ an, for example, measur@@ ing content based on how many people are wat@@ ch@@ ing, this gives us the basic data for looking at engage@@ ment proper@@ ties of cont@@ ent."
"W@@ e@@ 're asking things lik@@ e: Is this Ox@@ f@@ am don@@ ation form, where the regular month@@ ly don@@ ation is the pres@@ et def@@ aul@@ t, and people, maybe without inten@@ ding it, are encou@@ ra@@ ged or nu@@ d@@ ged into giving a regular don@@ ation instead of a one-@@ time don@@ ation, is that ""@@ still@@ ' per@@ mis@@ si@@ ble@@ ?"
"@@ It is interesting that in the United States, the most significant health@@ -@@ care budget goes to car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular disease care, whether it's private or public@@ ."
(Applause) There was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apar@@ t.
"@@ The autom@@ ob@@ ile be@@ com@@ es, then, an appli@@ ance -- not in a com@@ modi@@ ty sense, but an appli@@ ance, mobile power, mobile platform for information and comput@@ ing and communic@@ ation, as well as a form of transpor@@ ta@@ tion."
"A@@ s he said to me, that really p@@ is@@ sed the French off."
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle A@@ ges@@ ?
"@@ And when I had this thought, I was imag@@ ining that I would make -- I would have a whole machine theater ev@@ en@@ ing, where I would -- you would have an audi@@ ence, the cur@@ tain would op@@ en, and you'd be entertain@@ ed by machines on sta@@ ge."
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the ti@@ p of each controll@@ er is a relatively high-@@ performing inf@@ rar@@ ed camer@@ a.
"So we want things that n@@ est, we want things that stac@@ k, and we want it di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ed."
"@@ And when they do, we say that they've solved the puzz@@ le."
"@@ I really am hon@@ or@@ ed to be here, and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in Afric@@ a."
"@@ But sometimes I see this ing@@ en@@ i@@ ous idea in there, and I have this eu@@ rek@@ a mom@@ ent."
It's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clo@@ ck.
"@@ This is what I came to graduate school for, and this is how I would rather spend my life."
"@@ The word is ""@@ re@@ wild@@ ing@@ ,"" and even though re@@ wild@@ ing is a young word, it already has several defini@@ tions."
They're not as true as they could be.
"O@@ n your way to the air@@ por@@ t, if you pick up your boar@@ ding pas@@ s, it can tell you that your f@@ light is del@@ ay@@ ed, that the g@@ ate has change@@ d, etc."
He was sending me an original po@@ em that he had com@@ posed after our Tu@@ es@@ day morning together.
"@@ And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respec@@ t, instead of fear@@ ."
There's an air je@@ t that dri@@ es you.
And they themselves had not known they car@@ ed.
"@@ I mean, other animals may well have imagin@@ ations and creativ@@ ity, but it's not so much in eviden@@ ce, is it, as our@@ s?"
"@@ (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, El@@ on, about what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer feel gu@@ il@@ ty about energy."
But the more natural compar@@ ison is actually between India and Pakist@@ an.
And what it is -- it's actually ste@@ ak@@ .
You want to hear it played by different musici@@ an@@ s.
"So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of, which might be earthqu@@ ak@@ es, other relig@@ ion@@ s, maybe I'm afraid of terror@@ ists or shar@@ ks, anything that makes me feel@@ , assume you're going to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate the problem."
"@@ And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that, and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes, or whatever the time rema@@ in@@ s."
"@@ I'm going to play you now a sample of someone who ha@@ s, two people actually, who have severe speech dis@@ order@@ s."
"@@ But as people get more conserv@@ ative, the values ris@@ e."
So I try to create this energy of inven@@ tion every day in my studi@@ o.
Wh@@ o says A@@ ? Wh@@ o says B@@ ?
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my su@@ it@@ case today.
"So that's potentially absolutely disrup@@ tive technology, and, I gu@@ ess, pa@@ ves the way for your dream to actually tak@@ e, at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scal@@ e."
They're helping each other do it.
"F@@ rom the very first re@@ hear@@ s@@ al, I saw the b@@ right future ahe@@ ad."
"@@ Now, this Pe@@ ñ@@ a hardly inspired much confidence at fir@@ st."
"@@ If you don't know about ""@@ Sp@@ ir@@ ited A@@ way@@ "" and its direc@@ tor, Ha@@ y@@ a@@ o Mi@@ y@@ az@@ ak@@ i, first of all, you're wel@@ come."
"@@ You know, sometimes there's a 10-@@ , 15@@ -@@ minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in."
"J@@ F: Well, women are the fast@@ est growing demo@@ graphic in the world, especially older women."
"@@ It was the birth of my daughter that inspired me to la@@ unch this climate organiz@@ ation, in order to counter@@ act the exc@@ es@@ sive pol@@ ar@@ ization of this issue in the United States, and to find a conserv@@ ative path@@ way forwar@@ d."
"@@ And to this day, I have no answer for you."
And s@@ lei@@ ght of hand is just an art@@ ful demon@@ stration of de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity.
That's the kind of power I feel in this room.
"T@@ o dimension@@ alize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies made -- for cars, for computers, for phon@@ es, for fl@@ ash@@ ligh@@ ts, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world us@@ es."
"@@ Now, what you can't see is that our genetic program instruc@@ ts these bacteria to each produce small molecul@@ es, and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off."
"W@@ ell, instead of doing all of the spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation here on the Earth, what if we let the spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate themselv@@ es?"
"A@@ s a result, the way we think, we ac@@ t, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvi@@ ous."
"@@ And they do claim -- you know, this is an interesting ju@@ x@@ ta@@ position of the K@@ ing James Bi@@ ble and ""How T@@ o S@@ ell Y@@ our@@ self@@ ."""
O@@ r have these developing countries got smaller families and they live her@@ e?
K@@ B: Can you show us wher@@ e?
"B@@ M@@ I is fairly connected to your lifest@@ y@@ le, but we still can, we get in the ball@@ par@@ k, eight kil@@ ogra@@ ms of precis@@ ion@@ ."
It's going to be machin@@ e-@@ read@@ able.
M@@ T: B@@ y@@ e by@@ e. (Music) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
John@@ Ed@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m [@@ Dam@@ n liber@@ al@@ ] (Laughter) So we keep on insul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day.
So what did we find@@ ?
But algorith@@ m@@ ic bias can also lead to discrimin@@ atory practic@@ es.
We are at a remarkable moment in time.
It can break some@@ tim@@ es.
"M@@ el Gi@@ b@@ son did the sequ@@ el, you may have seen it."
This was the third tri@@ p.
And I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the an@@ ima@@ tion.
"W@@ hat it does is -- this is what's happening in Los Al@@ to@@ s -- it fre@@ es up time -- it's the block@@ ing and tac@@ kl@@ ing, making sure you know how to move through a system of equ@@ ations, and it fre@@ es up time for the simul@@ ations, for the games, for the mechan@@ ics, for the robo@@ t-@@ building, for the estim@@ ating how high that h@@ ill is based on its shado@@ w."
"@@ First of all, there's a real de@@ ar@@ th of data in the debat@@ e."
"@@ There's n@@ ano@@ technology coming on, n@@ an@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als."
"@@ Now that's one thing, of cour@@ se."
"So in 201@@ 1, I al@@ tered my name so that I could particip@@ ate in F@@ ar R@@ ight you@@ th cam@@ p in Hung@@ ar@@ y."
And one of them was [un@@ clear@@ ] who taught us physic@@ s.
"@@ How does evolution do cum@@ ul@@ ative, combin@@ atori@@ al thing@@ s?"
"S@@ l@@ ums are an im@@ perfect hous@@ ing solu@@ tion, but they are also pri@@ me examples of the innov@@ ation, adap@@ t@@ ability and resili@@ ence at the foundation -- and the heart -- of every func@@ tional city."
"H@@ um@@ ans, particularly so, we're very im@@ it@@ ative creatur@@ es."
"In Keny@@ a, 198@@ 4 is known as the year of the c@@ up, or the g@@ or@@ o g@@ or@@ o."
I cap@@ tured my observ@@ ations through time@@ -@@ lap@@ se photograph@@ y.
"@@ They don't use words like ""@@ left@@ "" and ""@@ right@@ ."""
"S@@ c@@ uba diver@@ s can't get there, sub@@ mar@@ ines go right on past it."
So it makes the materials environ@@ ment@@ ally active and inter@@ activ@@ e.
"@@ And they have belief@@ s about what other people want, and what other people don't want, how much power other people have, how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want."
So the college works following the lifest@@ yle and work@@ st@@ yle of Ma@@ hat@@ ma Gand@@ hi@@ .
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cas@@ es.
"@@ Gro@@ wing a mus@@ h@@ room is also part of a larger practice of cul@@ tiv@@ ating de@@ com@@ posing organisms called de@@ comp@@ icul@@ ture, a concept that was developed by an ent@@ om@@ olog@@ ist, Tim@@ o@@ th@@ y M@@ yl@@ es."
Lich@@ ens ar@@ ose as a co-@@ op@@ . F@@ ung@@ i married al@@ ga@@ e ...
"In@@ correc@@ t, abo@@ ve, which is what almost every swimming co@@ ach will teach you."
"So my final plan@@ k is, tell your story."
"A@@ nother issue is, a cit@@ y's like our family por@@ tra@@ it."
That way you could listen to cool music while you pre@@ tend to look for a job and you're really just ch@@ at@@ tin@@ ' with your p@@ als.
"@@ And in this, you'd have like a -- something that looks like a clou@@ d, and it is a cloud at the same time."
O@@ n the left we see people dy@@ ing; we see people running for their lives.
"A@@ t our lab Ro@@ Me@@ L@@ a, the Robo@@ tics and Mechanis@@ ms Labor@@ ator@@ y, we have these fantastic brain@@ stor@@ ming s@@ ession@@ s."
And I worked in min@@ es. And I realized that this was a world un@@ se@@ en.
They got 50 in@@ ches in three days.
"S@@ o, one of my most ill@@ ust@@ ri@@ ous for@@ e@@ be@@ ars at Man@@ ches@@ ter Universit@@ y, Ern@@ est Ru@@ ther@@ for@@ d, discover@@ er of the atom@@ ic nuc@@ le@@ us, once said, ""@@ All science is either physics or stam@@ p collec@@ t@@ ing."""
"@@ You mean all that time, up ti@@ ll today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it@@ ?"""
But then they went bank@@ rup@@ t and they never offered it.
"@@ I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater ar@@ c -- that is up and down -- and make them a lot eas@@ ier, so that you didn't have to use a button@@ ."
"@@ You might think of this as kind of like a primi@@ tive cell@@ . It is a simple chemical model of a living cell, and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together, play together in a complex network to produce something that we call ali@@ ve."
It became easier to feel a sense of normal@@ cy.
"@@ The police res@@ cu@@ ed this girl@@ , two other girl@@ s, and ar@@ res@@ ted three men, all at the Mo@@ tel 6 in San Jo@@ se."
"@@ But every single year, we have problems of floo@@ ding due to ra@@ in."
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
"W@@ ell actually, I was not s@@ ill@@ y."
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
"So I said it was the che@@ ap@@ est and fast@@ est way to do it, but in fact, actually, as you sa@@ w, they weren't able to do it, so it may not be so chea@@ p and fast@@ ."
And the light that sh@@ one off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever@@ .
"T@@ hat's certainly the case with robo@@ tics, but they also change the experience of the war@@ ri@@ or and even the very identity of the war@@ ri@@ or."
H@@ e's over there.
It's amazing.
Th@@ ree gra@@ ms a day.
"@@ And along comes p@@ ne@@ um@@ o@@ cocc@@ us or another bacter@@ ia, stre@@ p@@ to@@ cocc@@ us and bo@@ om, they get a bacterial p@@ ne@@ um@@ oni@@ a."
