"@@ But one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment, my wife and I decided that we would take the pas@@ sen@@ ger@@ 's se@@ at."
"@@ Well, I be@@ t I know how you'd solve that problem if you solved it."
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this pas@@ sive proper@@ ty.
"M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y G@@ ell@@ -@@ Man@@ n@@ : Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the ca@@ ve paint@@ ings and ca@@ ve en@@ grav@@ ings and ca@@ ve s@@ culp@@ tures and dance steps in the so@@ ft cl@@ ay in the ca@@ ves in Western Europe, in the A@@ ur@@ ig@@ na@@ ci@@ an P@@ eri@@ od some 3@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago, or earli@@ er."
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-@@ visual u@@ ser inter@@ fac@@ es.
"@@ It's free coo@@ king les@@ son@@ s, guys, in the Ma@@ in Stre@@ et."
But race also ten@@ ds to overwhel@@ m the clinical meas@@ ur@@ es.
"M@@ ost of the stories that these women, total stranger@@ s, send to me now, are not actually even about bre@@ ast@@ feed@@ ing."
"@@ We inter@@ viewed coup@@ les who received fer@@ til@@ ity treatment at Gh@@ ent University Hos@@ pit@@ al, using sper@@ m from a don@@ or."
"@@ So about that time, the National Fe@@ der@@ ation of the B@@ lin@@ d, or N@@ F@@ B, challeng@@ ed the research commit@@ te@@ e about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safe@@ ly and independ@@ ent@@ ly."
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 199@@ 0@@ s?
"@@ We then make that a video game to give patients simple, motiv@@ ating objec@@ tives to follow@@ ."
(Laughter) You can't have chemic@@ al-@@ free lum@@ p char@@ co@@ al.
"@@ Now, if that sounds pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous to you, or, you know, kind of craz@@ y, I'm right there with you, because frank@@ ly, if I had@@ n't seen the evidence for myself, decades of evidence for myself, I am fairly sure that I wouldn't believe it either@@ ."
girl@@ s.
"@@ What S@@ UN@@ D@@ A@@ R stands for@@ , in H@@ indi@@ , is ""@@ at@@ tr@@ activ@@ e."""
It's e@@ ka@@ -@@ alu@@ min@@ um. So were Mende@@ le@@ ev@@ 's predic@@ tions right?
Because I'm femal@@ e.
"@@ And then bring a team of experts in there to metho@@ dic@@ ally go through exactly what these people do, to dis@@ till down the cros@@ s-@@ cultural dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation."
(Laughter) So we've seen neuro@@ -@@ f@@ lap@@ do@@ od@@ le all over the head@@ lin@@ es.
"@@ I hun@@ g up and I started calling those plac@@ es, but it took me virtu@@ ally no time at all to discover that many of these facili@@ ties are ge@@ ar@@ ed towards those batt@@ ling long-term substance use disor@@ der."
What if everything we needed to realize our aspir@@ ation for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be cl@@ ai@@ me@@ d?
"@@ The really cool adv@@ ance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just an@@ ato@@ my but activ@@ ity, that is, where neurons are fir@@ ing."
It can be that people don't want to be friends with the girl that starts scre@@ aming in an al@@ ge@@ bra les@@ son@@ .
That's the problem.
"I@@ n our Western cultur@@ es, it means er@@ adi@@ ca@@ ting or re@@ vers@@ ing a disease, but in different cultur@@ es, for example, a culture from Asi@@ a, from the Mediter@@ ran@@ e@@ an, from L@@ ati@@ n countries, from Africa, it can mean many more things."
"@@ And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like some@@ thing's mis@@ s@@ ing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emo@@ tion."
"As the bacteria bur@@ st@@ s, the phages move out and go on the hun@@ t again for a new bacteria to infec@@ t."
"@@ And finally, there was a population of students that were taught in a one-@@ on-@@ one instruc@@ tion using a tu@@ tor@@ ."
"@@ And actually, I have some exampl@@ es, because what's better reven@@ ge than dis@@ playing their idi@@ oc@@ y?"
"@@ And by the way, this is one of the most fundamental discover@@ ies of modern micro@@ biolog@@ y."
"@@ You know, I was wondering about Fre@@ udi@@ an determin@@ ant@@ s: Why K@@ er@@ mit@@ ?"
And that's when I discovered come@@ d@@ y.
"@@ But by far the worst thing we do to mal@@ es, by making them feel that they have to be hard, is that we leave them with very frag@@ ile eg@@ os."
(Applause) We have to recognize a couple of things here.
"@@ And this mar@@ ked the start of an eigh@@ t-@@ year-@@ long correspon@@ den@@ ce that God knows was never easy, but always honest@@ ."
"P@@ ut the sun and the mo@@ on sh@@ ining together, it's b@@ right@@ ness."
"@@ Well, it depends on what you think of as our bodi@@ es."
You will see how that go@@ es.
I think it would be a better world.
"@@ Now this, for me, is a common situ@@ ation."
"O@@ ne is, we can make better use of the oil that we have, and that's analog@@ ous to making better use of existing antibiotics, and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a second, but the other option is the ""@@ dr@@ ill@@ , baby, dr@@ ill@@ "" op@@ tion, which in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibio@@ tics."
And we make a dro@@ p@@ -@@ in replac@@ ement for that plastic that's made from petro@@ chemic@@ als.
"@@ Th@@ ey're rela@@ ted, because if we invest heav@@ ily in new oil well@@ s, we reduce the incentiv@@ es for conserv@@ ation of oil in the same way that's going to happen for antibio@@ tics."
You really are alive right here in this moment.
"@@ So for example, if you were to walk into a ba@@ ker@@ y, your brain might predict that you will encounter the deli@@ cious ar@@ oma of fresh@@ ly ba@@ ked chocolate chi@@ p coo@@ ki@@ es."
"@@ And as you see it come out, in order to actually be able to do anything use@@ ful, it can't all stay clus@@ tered up like this."
The video game industry in 200@@ 5 became a 29 billion dollar busines@@ s.
We are good at making war@@ .
"@@ So what I've been discus@@ sing is, the seven and a half billion people in the world don't actually deserve to have their environment s@@ mas@@ hed by plas@@ tic, their oce@@ ans ren@@ dered de@@ pa@@ u@@ per@@ ate or bar@@ ren of sea life because of plas@@ tic."
"@@ And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastin@@ ation."
S@@ pir@@ itu@@ al@@ it@@ y? And how about how we socializ@@ e?
"@@ But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our ac@@ tions, we let go of old hab@@ its and form new on@@ es."
This was a good day.
It's not pleas@@ ant.
And then there are very fine things.
I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life.
"@@ And trag@@ ically in [@@ 200@@ 3@@ ], a scientist was taken down and dro@@ w@@ ned, and she was being consu@@ med by a leopard se@@ al."
And this is also what it's like when the drug trade and use affects every aspect of life in the neighborhoo@@ d.
"@@ Right? It is traumatic stress like active comb@@ at or natural disas@@ ters or community violence or sexual assaul@@ t that causes post-@@ traumatic stress disor@@ der, and not everyone that is exposed to stress develo@@ ps a mood disor@@ der."
"H@@ e's like, ""You idio@@ t. You mor@@ on."
"S@@ ti@@ ll, good inten@@ tions can have un@@ intended consequen@@ ces, and so I want to pro@@ pose that stories are not as magi@@ cal as they seem@@ ."
"@@ And this ability to experience stress and be resili@@ ent and boun@@ ce back and not develop depression or PT@@ S@@ D is known as stress resili@@ ence, and it vari@@ es between people."
We look at the savings rate and it has been de@@ clin@@ ing since the 1950@@ s.
"B@@ u@@ il@@ d@@ ings are complex eco@@ systems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us, and some that are bad for us."
"F@@ ive years in gra@@ d school, a few years, you know, I'm at Nor@@ th@@ w@@ ester@@ n, I moved to Harvar@@ d, I'm at Harvar@@ d, I'm not really thinking about it any@@ more, but for a long time I had been thinking, ""No@@ t supposed to be here@@ ."""
"@@ And you might be thinking, well, that's not particularly stress@@ ful."
"@@ When you're in the low-@@ power pose condition, only 60 percent, and that's a wh@@ op@@ ping significant differen@@ ce."
"@@ So that when we begin to grap@@ ple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, ""C@@ an we build it?"""
"@@ And she became D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ f@@ f, the presid@@ ent@@ -@@ elec@@ t of one of the biggest democraci@@ es in the world, moving from minis@@ ter of energy to presid@@ ent."
Wh@@ o are you?
"@@ (Laughter) So ide@@ ally, what you want to do is a tri@@ al."
"@@ The simple answer is: no one has developed this kind of a drug yet, at least not one that con@@ forms to the Western regul@@ atory standar@@ ds that set the nor@@ m for so much of the world."
"@@ And the other present was a photo of my grand@@ mother, who committed suici@@ de."
So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes st@@ are back at me through a televisi@@ on.
It's a remark@@ ably beautiful lands@@ ca@@ pe. I can't even begin to describe it to you.
"A@@ ll this complex@@ ity, all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a proper@@ ty of an old and cold and complicated universe."
And I ended the study the next day.
"@@ But the world has change@@ d, and it's over@@ due to up@@ grade that mind@@ set and that tax@@ on@@ o@@ my of the world, and to understand it."
"F@@ or example, commun@@ ality app@@ lies most naturally within family or friends, but it can be used to try to trans@@ fer the ment@@ ality of sharing to groups that ordin@@ arily would not be dis@@ posed to exercise it."
I'm not interested in fil@@ ming the violence and the weap@@ ons.
L@@ as@@ sa virus is a lot like E@@ bol@@ a.
"@@ This is a sun placed with the ori@@ g@@ in, because Jap@@ an lies to the e@@ ast of Chin@@ a."
"@@ But occasion@@ ally, just occasion@@ ally, I hope you will open up your suit@@ cases for other people to see, because the world needs you and it needs the things you car@@ r@@ y."
"@@ When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which -- I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the ker@@ n@@ el, we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that's every two months, roughly two or three month@@ s."
"@@ The first brain@@ -@@ control@@ led ex@@ os@@ ke@@ le@@ ton to be built was named after the most famous Braz@@ ili@@ an scientist ever@@ , Al@@ ber@@ to San@@ tos Du@@ mon@@ t, who, on Oc@@ to@@ ber 19@@ , 19@@ 0@@ 1, created and fle@@ w himself the first control@@ led air@@ ship on air in Paris for a million people to see."
This increased representation can lead to phantom pain@@ .
"@@ But that day, I watched in wonder as the words stream@@ ed out of my pen@@ , forming the most pi@@ vo@@ tal letter I've ever writ@@ ten, addres@@ sed to Tom@@ ."
The learning cur@@ ve was very long@@ .
"@@ The result, put another way, was h@@ ell@@ ."
"@@ I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocola@@ te, whose kin@@ ky ha@@ ir could not form pon@@ y@@ tail@@ s, could also exist in liter@@ atu@@ re."
"A@@ t five years old, I thought everyone was just like me."
"@@ And we know that you can be lon@@ ely in a crow@@ d and you can be lon@@ ely in a marri@@ age, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationshi@@ p, but it's the quality of your close relationships that mat@@ ters."
"@@ I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time manag@@ em@@ ent, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are gener@@ ally certain but specifically remain ambigu@@ ous."
"@@ (Applause) And I want to be clear about what I'm saying, because I deeply believe our offic@@ es should be encour@@ aging casu@@ al, ch@@ at@@ ty ca@@ fe@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le types of interac@@ tions -- you know, the kind where people come together and ser@@ en@@ di@@ pit@@ ously have an exchange of ideas."
But their habit of treating patients by race lag@@ s far behin@@ d.
So it's either a large body or a large number of neuron@@ s.
"@@ What we'd really like is a quick fix@@ , something we can get that@@ 'll make our lives good and keep them that way."
You begin dro@@ w@@ ning in worri@@ es about dan@@ g@@ ers that aren't present@@ .
This has to do with writing direc@@ tion.
"@@ Your brain is basically making predic@@ tions, gues@@ ses, that it's construc@@ ting in the moment with billions of neurons working together."
And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of micro@@ organis@@ ms in@@ side.
And you can see that the camera is trac@@ king him and er@@ as@@ ing.
"B@@ ut, there is good new@@ s."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y years ago, a new generation of anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs were brought in@@ ; the promise was they would have fewer side effec@@ ts."
"@@ The website says, ""If you look, there's an individual muta@@ tion, and maybe a second, and maybe a thir@@ d, and that is cancer@@ ."""
So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can ta@@ ke.
They are places for acu@@ te trauma and treat@@ able ill@@ ness.
"@@ It's a be@@ ard tr@@ im@@ mer, you see@@ ?"
And one of the second common@@ est is carto@@ ons.
"S@@ o, I want to just remind every@@ body, throughout the world, one of the things is, we have pow@@ er, poor people have pow@@ er, every citiz@@ en has pow@@ er."
T: I don't ever want to let my country down@@ !
No open surgery was necess@@ ary.
You've read about it al@@ read@@ y.
"@@ The drug lor@@ ds were kind of worried about us fil@@ ming in the place, so I told them, ""You know what?"
She had for@@ gotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was ... obvi@@ ous.
"@@ What they're propos@@ ing is an almost four@@ -@@ times increase in produc@@ tion, and that would industri@@ alize an area the size of Flor@@ ida@@ ."
"@@ So beyond s@@ pati@@ al memory, if we look for this gr@@ id@@ -like firing pattern throughout the whole brain, we see it in a whole series of loca@@ tions which are always active when we do all kinds of auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal memory tas@@ ks, like remember@@ ing the last time you went to a we@@ d@@ ding, for example."
"@@ I used to think I have to accompl@@ ish all these things -- have to be a great entrepren@@ eur@@ , or get a Ph@@ D to teach -- but no, I just asked, and I could teach@@ ."
"@@ Now, for my organization Global W@@ it@@ ness, this expos@@ é has been phenomen@@ al."
It's not because their DNA has de@@ gener@@ ated.
"S@@ o, with the combin@@ ation of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all."
"@@ Now, can anybody spot a f@@ law in this desig@@ n@@ ?"
This is the result that's been replica@@ ted over and over again.
"@@ When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad@@ ."
(Laughter) But the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue ball@@ s.
We're not going to be able to make a dinosau@@ r based on a dinosaur@@ .
We also have to have energ@@ y.
"@@ And we predicted what would happen@@ , and we got it all wrong."
And you must have seen this illusi@@ on.
"I@@ t creates a reality of money, proper@@ ty, government, marri@@ age, CE@@ R@@ N confer@@ en@@ ces, co@@ ck@@ tail parti@@ es and summer vaca@@ tions, and all of those are cre@@ ations of conscious@@ ness."
There are people who care about the U@@ I@@ .
It was the best thing that ever happened in my life.
"@@ Wh@@ o, I wonder@@ ed, is going to give them imagination and st@@ am@@ ina and bra@@ very when the stor@@ ms come@@ ?"
Let's picture your risk of Alzheimer's as a see@@ -@@ saw scal@@ e.
"@@ And the power of this is not that it's done occasion@@ ally, the power is it's done every week for a life@@ time."
"@@ So the more d@@ ust you have, the more it will reve@@ al the pho@@ to."
"@@ When I was learning Span@@ ish, I was bor@@ ed with the text in the tex@@ t@@ boo@@ k."
"@@ (Laughter) S@@ end 1,@@ 500 pounds via a Gi@@ ant G@@ um@@ my L@@ iz@@ ar@@ d."""
Because living so health@@ ily was killing me.
But let's not stop at that.
"@@ Now there's just one problem with this line of reason@@ ing, and that's that the insul@@ a does a lot."
"S@@ econ@@ d, I call this ""the mi@@ xer@@ ."""
But focus@@ ing only on the rate of prescri@@ bing risks over@@ looking two cruci@@ ally important point@@ s.
"@@ What all adminis@@ tra@@ tions say when there's a scan@@ dal@@ : ""D@@ on't bl@@ ame us. It's not the system."
M@@ aybe we've all been this guy.
I mean that's a fabul@@ ous amount of money.
"@@ You're probably thinking, my kid would never sex@@ t."
So the tall@@ est person of all time was a guy named Robert W@@ ad@@ low who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11@@ .
"L@@ ast words said to his mother who was also tor@@ tured to death@@ : ""D@@ on't wor@@ r@@ y. The United N@@ ations are com@@ ing."""
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.
"@@ (Laughter) I said, ""S@@ olo@@ mon@@ , I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspon@@ den@@ ce@@ : L@@ aw@@ y@@ er: G@@ um@@ my B@@ ear@@ ."
"@@ Now, the same holds for train@@ ing@@ -based treat@@ ments."
"@@ And I was like, ""OK, smart guys, this is what's happening to me, and if you have an explan@@ ation for me, I would love to hear it."""
I went to the eye of the stor@@ m.
And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months pri@@ or called Ch@@ an@@ ge@@ .@@ org@@ .
"@@ There will still be expensive treat@@ ments, huge fric@@ tion from our insur@@ ance system."
"@@ And that's sort of the body chan@@ nel of emotional empath@@ y, which many animals have."
"@@ And when we sequence the DNA from these animals, we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it, using the CRISPR technology."
We all know that explor@@ ation is ris@@ k@@ y.
I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice co@@ ach@@ es.
"I@@ f you go into a country with the right tools and the right way, you do it vi@@ gor@@ ously, you can actually get a local er@@ adi@@ ca@@ tion."
"A@@ t the University of H@@ el@@ sin@@ k@@ i, I had a friend who was one of the open source -- it was called main@@ ly ""@@ free softw@@ are@@ "" back then -- and he actually introduced me to the notion that, he@@ y, you can use these open-@@ source li@@ cen@@ ses that had been around."
"@@ W@@ ith the fas@@ t-@@ food industry you know, it's very competi@@ tive."
Thank you.
"@@ So for instance, go back to the ta@@ per@@ ing reg@@ im@@ en that I was gi@@ ven@@ ."
We inter@@ view them in their living room@@ s.
"@@ They expect their partner@@ s, their s@@ pou@@ ses, their wi@@ ves, to work outside the home and be just as committed to their care@@ ers as they are."
"I@@ n it, they teach physicians how to ta@@ per opioid@@ s in the easier cases, and one of the their recommen@@ da@@ tions is that you never start at more than a 10 percent dose redu@@ ction per week."
"S@@ o, I set up scientific criteri@@ a as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer."
C@@ la@@ im your experien@@ ce.
"@@ I took a picture of this, hu@@ gg@@ ed her and walked away."
"In@@ stead, the contex@@ t, the common ground activi@@ ties, are the content on television that's driving the conversa@@ tions."
So first I started with the mind.
"@@ It's called apro@@ pos of the Ital@@ ian ad@@ age that I lif@@ ted from his for@@ ward, ""If This B@@ e T@@ reason@@ ."""
"@@ So remember, you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you, keeping you health@@ y."
But this one died at the age of 16@@ .
"@@ And so it makes you wonder, what would happen if we had@@ n't tas@@ ted the fru@@ it of knowled@@ ge, so to speak, and what kind of mor@@ ality would we have."
I was allowed to bring my baby to work.
"@@ You go to the websi@@ te, fill out the form, give them $@@ 6@@ 0, it arri@@ ves in the pos@@ t."
C@@ an we build an intelligent compu@@ ter@@ ?
"In@@ v@@ est, invest@@ , invest@@ ."""
And that's me right there in a brown co@@ at.
"@@ Th@@ en, if we take this specific pattern of micro@@ RNA of this person's samples and compare it with existing scientific document@@ ation that cor@@ rela@@ tes micro@@ RNA patterns with a specific presence of a disease, this is how pancreatic cancer looks like."
"I@@ f you save very little, the future self is un@@ happy living on 4@@ 4 percent of the in@@ come@@ ."
Than@@ ks very much.
"@@ (Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order to have a pol@@ ite conversa@@ tion, we just had to follow the advice of H@@ en@@ ry Hig@@ g@@ ins in ""My F@@ air L@@ ad@@ y@@ ""@@ : S@@ tic@@ k to the wea@@ ther and your health."
The first group started in the study when they were so@@ pho@@ mor@@ es at Harvard Col@@ le@@ ge.
"S@@ o, this is the website of the National Cancer Institu@@ te."
"@@ So where did it come from, and how did it get here@@ ?"
"@@ So with the ma@@ ps that we make on boar@@ d, we get about 100@@ -@@ meter resolu@@ tion, enough to pick out areas to de@@ plo@@ y our equip@@ ment, but not enough to see very much."
"@@ (Laughter) O@@ f course a lot of this was ton@@ gu@@ e-@@ in-@@ che@@ e@@ k, but that word feminist is so heav@@ y with bag@@ g@@ age, negative bag@@ g@@ age."
San@@ dr@@ ine Th@@ ure@@ t: V@@ ery good.
So a second line of in@@ quir@@ y that we use to track changes in the adoles@@ cent brain is using functional MRI to look at changes in brain activity across age.
"O@@ f course, it got much better after that."
"@@ But then, the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened."
"@@ We found that we have, on average, 8@@ 6 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex, and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awar@@ eness and logical and abstract reason@@ ing, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex h@@ as, I think this is the simpl@@ est explan@@ ation for our remarkable cognitive abili@@ ties."
"A@@ G: O@@ kay, that's a fourth hypothes@@ is."
I was 19@@ .
(Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interac@@ tion.
"@@ How do we say who or what can be part of this categor@@ y?"""
"I@@ n that case, we can see how where they think the fla@@ g had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment."
H@@ ere we're as@@ king@@ : How similar are they@@ ?
"@@ And what's happening is that there's a glob@@ aliz@@ ation of illness occurr@@ ing, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one gener@@ ation, for example, Asi@@ a's gone from having one of the low@@ est rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the high@@ est. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equ@@ als the HIV and AID@@ S deaths in most countri@@ es."
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for 20@@ 70 for there to be trou@@ ble.
And I think that's how we got to become human@@ .
(Laughter) So what are the first ste@@ p@@ s?
"@@ That quo@@ te was said by a white man, Robert M@@ orit@@ z, chair@@ person, Pr@@ ice@@ water@@ house@@ Co@@ oper@@ s, he asked me to include it in my tal@@ k."
"@@ But if you do one step every time, maybe you don't care as much."
"A@@ ll you have to do is prove any par@@ an@@ or@@ mal, oc@@ cul@@ t or super@@ natural event or power of any kind under proper obser@@ ving condi@@ tions."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by it@@ self.
"@@ Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [@@ develo@@ ped@@ ] world, are rapidly spir@@ aling out of control, and a huge ch@@ un@@ k of those costs are human resour@@ ce cost@@ s."
"B@@ ut, you know, I want my kids to succe@@ ed in life and this isn't going to get them there."
I was fascinated by this weird concep@@ tion: viruses cur@@ ing an infec@@ tion.
""@@ "No one will mar@@ ry you this wa@@ y."""
That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Th@@ ird World every year.
"Un@@ fortunately, what is far@@ med ends up as what we e@@ at."
Mor@@ al ambigu@@ ity are televisi@@ ons shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong.
W@@ e've got education connected to story@@ telling triang@@ ul@@ ated next to social medi@@ a.
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people.
So I -- (Applause) So I tra@@ ve@@ led back to Ber@@ lin@@ .
"O@@ n@@ ce all the missing person@@ s are identi@@ fi@@ ed, only deca@@ ying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will rema@@ in."
We need to go visit a few medical marijuana dispens@@ ari@@ es.
This char@@ t shows the de@@ cl@@ ine in ocean wil@@ d@@ life from 19@@ 00 to 20@@ 00@@ .
"I@@ f we look at the genetic difference between humans, great ap@@ es, and r@@ hes@@ us ma@@ ca@@ qu@@ es, that number is seven percent."
Ya@@ y?
"@@ I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another pre@@ condi@@ tion: I call them pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous."
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this visi@@ on.
What are they thinking and feel@@ ing?
"@@ And to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab@@ ."
"@@ The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electron@@ ic health record, we make sure we put a place history inside that medical recor@@ d."
And the rest of you have seen such children.
"@@ Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human cultu@@ re."
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really under@@ goes dramatic development during the period of adolescen@@ ce.
"@@ I was like, ""I can@@ '@@ t, I'm expec@@ ting an email about some gol@@ d."""

"@@ But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this dist@@ as@@ te that people still have for the idea of treatment, the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indi@@ g@@ ent communi@@ ties, that would be exp@@ loit@@ ativ@@ e, because we would be changing them."
"@@ Th@@ ink of it as being kind of the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zing of a city or of a for@@ est, because it clear@@ s it away."

"I@@ n this other version of the experiment, we didn't put people in this situ@@ ation, we just described to them the situ@@ ation, much as I am describing to you now, and we asked them to predict what the result would be."
But I know what you're think@@ ing.
What's tr@@ ending now@@ ? What's the popular talk now@@ ?
"@@ And we also use functional MR@@ I, called f@@ MR@@ I, to take a video, a movi@@ e, of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or percei@@ ving something."

But there's a problem with this ros@@ y picture of kids being so much better than adul@@ ts.
"@@ The sad reality is, we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the path@@ og@@ en pos@@ es to people, but on how econom@@ ically ris@@ ky it is to develop these vaccin@@ es."
"@@ But than@@ k@@ fully, today, most of humanity lives in far more pe@@ ace@@ ful socie@@ ties, and when there is conflic@@ t, we, especially in the United States, now have the technology to put our warri@@ ors through advanced training, drop them in to fight anywhere on the glo@@ be and when they're done, j@@ et them back to pe@@ ace@@ time sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a."

"@@ We see these ideas again and again in the media, in public health polic@@ y, doctor@@ s' offic@@ es, in everyday conversations and in our own at@@ titu@@ des@@ ."
"[@@ Wh@@ o are the people who should be most concerned about this@@ ?] Well, the most concerned are people who are, first of all, in developing countries and who don't have access to good medical care and may not have access at all to a hospital, should an epidemic occur in their country."
H@@ ere are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to.
"F@@ or example, I found if I just don't run@@ , if I got rejec@@ ted, I could actually turn a ""@@ no@@ "" into a ""@@ y@@ es@@ ,"" and the magic word is, ""@@ wh@@ y."""
