One of the patients with whom we de@@ plo@@ yed is actually my a@@ un@@ t.

So let's see what's really going on here.
"@@ He is very, very angr@@ y."
"@@ But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more natural way of communica@@ tion, which is a di@@ alo@@ gue, in which it's not only me speaking to you now, but a more natural way of talking, in which I am speaking and I am listen@@ ing, and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas."
"@@ But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time, and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shel@@ ves."
These conversations are for in@@ tras@@ pe@@ ci@@ es communica@@ tion.

I think there is outer truth and there's inner tru@@ th.
"@@ But in many ways, that image of the cons@@ pir@@ acy still sticks with us."
"""@@ It's really not the whole world I can change@@ ."""
We continu@@ ously opened clin@@ ic@@ s.
"@@ And we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultur@@ es, we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between grou@@ ps."
Wh@@ ich in my experience means communication that manag@@ es to speak to and expand our concept of self-@@ interest@@ .
To@@ da@@ y's best variety is tomor@@ row@@ 's lun@@ ch for insec@@ ts or p@@ ests or disease.

"@@ So pick one idea, and make it the through@@ -@@ line running through your entire talk, so that everything you say lin@@ ks back to it in some way."
D@@ octors start speaking a language which you don't understand@@ .
And it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal func@@ tions.
Because we had training going on up north al@@ read@@ y.
"@@ I can't get enough of that feel@@ ing, and that's why I learn a language every two years."
"@@ And the bottom line of this part of my talk is this: You can have a completely objective science, a science where you make objec@@ tively true claim@@ s, about a do@@ main whose existence is subjec@@ tive, whose existence is in the human brain consist@@ ing of subjec@@ tive states of senti@@ ence or feeling or awar@@ enes@@ s."
G@@ o and look behind the M@@ oun@@ tain@@ s.
"@@ And then as the cells gro@@ w, they're all releas@@ ing that molecule into the environment, so there's lots of molecule there."

I thought I was very cle@@ ver.
"@@ Well, that's because you've got recep@@ tors in your skin@@ , touch and pain recep@@ tors, going back into your brain and saying ""D@@ on't wor@@ r@@ y, you're not being touche@@ d."

And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.
Now here's a story from my childhoo@@ d.
(Laughter) Al G@@ ore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate cris@@ is.
"I@@ f you look up sub@@ clinical ac@@ n@@ e, you may find a websi@@ te, which I did, which says that this is the easi@@ est type of ac@@ ne to treat@@ ."
So we have to end it straigh@@ ta@@ way. W@@ e've got no time.
These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reser@@ ved exclusi@@ vely to non@@ e.
And this is basically the result we had before.
You can just hold up fing@@ ers.
"@@ We are allowing the rating ag@@ encies to be in@@ transpar@@ ent about their work, and we need to change this."
"@@ So even though babies are going to see much less evidence for sque@@ a@@ king, and have many fewer actions to imit@@ ate in this one ball condition than in the condition you just sa@@ w, we predicted that babies themselves would squee@@ ze more, and that's exactly what we foun@@ d."
Pro@@ bab@@ ly something really un@@ pleas@@ ant.
S@@ he's never going to know a world where the graph@@ ics just aren't st@@ un@@ ning and really im@@ mer@@ si@@ ve.
But you know what? We encounter hard@@ shi@@ ps.
"@@ And so what happens is, every morning when the sun comes up, the squ@@ id goes back to sleep, it bur@@ ies itself in the san@@ d, and it's got a pu@@ mp that's att@@ ach@@ ed to its cir@@ ca@@ di@@ an rhyth@@ m."
No@@ ! No@@ !
But you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succe@@ ed.
"@@ Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie ""F@@ ar@@ go@@ ."""
"@@ Hu@@ mans in the developed world spend more than 90 percent of their lives in@@ do@@ ors, where they brea@@ the in and come into contact with tr@@ illi@@ ons of life forms invisible to the na@@ ked eye@@ : micro@@ organis@@ ms."
"O@@ n@@ e, you're not going to be surpris@@ ed."
And I took on a role of care@@ ta@@ ker of my home and of my si@@ bl@@ ings.
"@@ And as we kept on scan@@ ning more and more, working on this project, looking at these two simple cells that have this un@@ believ@@ able machinery that will become the magic of you."
"@@ Because if you communicate an idea in a way that reson@@ ates, change will happen@@ , and you can change the world."
W@@ ould the same kind of mis@@ takes be made with a really stressful event@@ ?
"@@ I was sitting on a bed in a hos@@ tel in South America, and I was watching the person I love walk out the do@@ or."
Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a les@@ ion@@ ?
"@@ They are training to be teach@@ ers, and they are running busines@@ ses."
"@@ Well, guess what?"
"U@@ p on the scre@@ en, that is Bon@@ o."
It's incredi@@ ble.
H@@ ave I gotten the right one?
I assumed I would die -- (@@ Cr@@ y@@ ing) I'm sorr@@ y.
"@@ So in study one, the ambigu@@ ous situ@@ ation, I'm currently watching the child."
"@@ They wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language, never achiev@@ ing flu@@ en@@ cy, and here I come, learning one language after another."
To@@ day I believe Big Bro@@ ther would find much more success brain@@ washing the mas@@ ses with video games rather than just simply TV@@ s.
"@@ These scan@@ s, the clinics say, can help prevent Alzheimer's disease, solve weight and addic@@ tion issu@@ es, overcome mar@@ ital conflic@@ ts, and treat@@ , of course, a variety of mental illnes@@ ses ran@@ ging from depression to anxiety to AD@@ H@@ D@@ ."
"@@ And -- (Laughter) Th@@ en reality took hol@@ d, and over the course of a mon@@ th, I got 19@@ 9 rejec@@ tions out of those 200 email@@ s."
"@@ It's not just because people would know where the women's ba@@ th@@ rooms are, even though that would be very help@@ ful."
"@@ W@@ ho@@ a, that's a lot more people."
So we have lots of great exampl@@ es.
"@@ So in this next experiment, we're going to give babies just a tiny bit of sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ cal data suppor@@ ting one hypothes@@ is over the other, and we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do."
Now this is a particularly fr@@ ustrat@@ ing plac@@ ement of the need@@ le.
We can turn things that might seem small and ob@@ s@@ cure and blow them up until they're like cons@@ tell@@ ations of information about life.
And for that reason there are many surgeri@@ es that just aren't being done with the da V@@ inci@@ .
"@@ They have no idea who's been pos@@ ing in what pos@@ e, and they end up looking at these sets of ta@@ pes, and they say, ""We want to h@@ ire these people@@ ,"" all the high-@@ power pos@@ ers."
"@@ But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for."
"@@ But about four centur@@ ies before Chr@@ ist, this starts r@@ amp@@ ing up very rapidly to an almost fi@@ ve-@@ f@@ old increase of books getting clos@@ er, and closer and closer to the concept of introspec@@ tion."
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serv@@ ing.
"I@@ f your le@@ g is ch@@ op@@ ped off and you lose bloo@@ d, your body will clam@@ p down, increase the heart rate, do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up."
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
T@@ o picture multiple possible ver@@ sions of the future.
I developed a detector that re@@ places the current detec@@ tors that H@@ ome@@ land S@@ ec@@ ur@@ ity h@@ as.
It's the spirit of our cultu@@ re.
You could light up a village with this gu@@ y's ey@@ es.

A@@ re you aware of how your mind reac@@ ts to fail@@ ure@@ ?
"@@ They changed signals, they changed lan@@ es, everything they could do to make Times Squ@@ are work better."
So this is a very early proto@@ ty@@ pe.
"@@ But for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GM@@ T is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about -- that we can't even imagine at this point, something completely new@@ ."
"@@ So in a study done in Ten@@ nes@@ see, researchers plan@@ ted the false memory that when you were a kid, you nearly dro@@ w@@ ned and had to be rescu@@ ed by a life guar@@ d."

"@@ And so this leopard se@@ al grab@@ bed another pengu@@ in, came under the bo@@ at, the Z@@ odi@@ ac@@ , starting h@@ itting the h@@ ul@@ l of the bo@@ at."

"@@ The cha@@ ins are very tin@@ y, about the wid@@ th of a bio@@ molecule, and these poly@@ mers are really den@@ se."
The other tr@@ end I have seen in China is social shop@@ p@@ ing.
"@@ RNA is a chemical cous@@ in of DNA, and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a mat@@ ching sequen@@ ce."
"@@ So our work, in a certain way, is to address this imag@@ o, this kind of ar@@ che@@ type that has per@@ va@@ ded the psy@@ che of our entire glo@@ be."
"@@ And then, of course, we have to wonder what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mo@@ od, or sick or impot@@ ent."
And we'll make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.

"@@ But tell me, adver@@ tis@@ ing for what?"
We surve@@ yed organis@@ ms from all over the tree of life -- every king@@ dom of life but anim@@ al@@ s; we see slightly different@@ ly.

"@@ We knew that, when mon@@ ol@@ ingu@@ als were tested in T@@ ai@@ pei and Se@@ at@@ tle on the Mand@@ ar@@ in soun@@ ds, they showed the same patter@@ n."
I have a small lab@@ .
It never sto@@ ps being plas@@ tic.
"@@ This picture here shows the trop@@ hy fish, the biggest fish cau@@ ght by people who pay a lot of money to get on a bo@@ at, go to a place off of K@@ ey West in Flor@@ ida, drink a lot of be@@ er, throw a lot of hoo@@ ks and lines into the water, come back with the biggest and the best fish, and the cham@@ pi@@ on trop@@ hy fish are put on this boar@@ d, where people take a picture, and this guy is obviously really excited about that fis@@ h."
"To@@ day, it's the second largest economy in the world, an industrial power@@ house, and its people live in increasing prosper@@ ity."
So we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.
"@@ That's what we call a chemical reac@@ tion, when atoms exchange part@@ ners and make new molecul@@ es."
"@@ The era of the ""@@ big surge@@ on, big inci@@ sion@@ "" had arri@@ ved, but at quite a cost@@ , because they are saving lives, but not necessarily quality of life, because healthy people don't usually need surger@@ y, and unh@@ eal@@ thy people have a very hard time recover@@ ing from a cut like that."
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad@@ .
I talked to O@@ mar for 15 minut@@ es.
"@@ And yet, in two million years, the human brain has nearly tri@@ p@@ led in mas@@ s, going from the one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ quar@@ ter@@ -@@ p@@ ound brain of our ancest@@ or here, H@@ abil@@ is, to the almost three-@@ p@@ ound me@@ at@@ lo@@ a@@ f everybody here has between their ear@@ s."
"@@ (Laughter) An@@ y@@ way, as I pl@@ un@@ ged through my 20@@ s ever more aware of how un@@ ob@@ tain@@ able the first part of my childhood ambi@@ tion was, it was that second part, being able to success@@ fully communicate to others whatever knowledge I was ga@@ in@@ ing, where the fu@@ til@@ ity of my qu@@ est really set in."
"I@@ f you ask any@@ one, ""What is mor@@ ality based on@@ ?"""
"O@@ f@@ ten, people are good at things they don't really care for."

"I@@ t can be very difficult for law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement or tax auth@@ ori@@ ties, journal@@ ists, civil society to really understand what's going on."

"@@ You see, as I got ol@@ der, while I was gra@@ te@@ ful for this amazing opportunity that I was being gi@@ ven, there was this ever@@ -@@ present pan@@ g of@@ : But what about everyone else@@ ?"
"I@@ t used to be that you had to go to a classroom, and there would be some di@@ li@@ g@@ ent teacher -- some geni@@ us teacher in there -- but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then, and then was not most times."

It's this enz@@ y@@ me that we are attemp@@ ting to block@@ .
"@@ This is the San Francis@@ co study group, but there were ones all over the world."
"@@ And so, I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly, it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benef@@ its, and it can be quite popul@@ ar."

"@@ (Applause) So in about seven years of doing nuclear research, I started out with a dream to make a ""@@ star in a j@@ ar@@ ,"" a star in my gar@@ age, and I ended up meeting the presid@@ ent and developing things that I think can change the world, and I think other kids can too."
That's why you have to move back and for@@ th.
So here's another example.
Now you can see that the waste far out@@ weigh@@ s the actually useful amoun@@ t.
"@@ These mo@@ ons, which are not in what we call a traditional habit@@ able z@@ one, that are out in the solar system, have liquid water."
"P@@ e@@ op@@ le believe that when we deal with physical attrac@@ tion, we see some@@ body, and we know immediately whether we like them or not, if we're attrac@@ ted or not."
"@@ And then, when she closed the door, Gr@@ and@@ ma said, ""No, no, no, no@@ !"
And cost is one of them.
N@@ ur@@ ses have a really unique relationship with us because of the time spent at bed@@ side.
"@@ So what are emo@@ tions, re@@ all@@ y?"
I wish I could speak with that woman again.
"@@ When S@@ adi@@ ye found me at the end of the night she was horri@@ fi@@ ed, and we got back on the ph@@ one."
You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medi@@ cal@@ iz@@ ed.
"A glass of w@@ ine or two now makes me we@@ ave as if acting the dr@@ un@@ k@@ ar@@ d's part@@ ; as if, bes@@ o@@ t@@ ted with un@@ requi@@ ted love for the dynam@@ ic Tur@@ ner can@@ vas@@ ses spi@@ ed out by the Hub@@ ble, I could l@@ ur@@ ch down a city street set without provo@@ king every pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an wal@@ k-@@ on star@@ e."
"@@ And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Ste@@ ve@@ 's colum@@ ns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movi@@ e, with Robert D@@ ow@@ ney J@@ r. acting as Steve Lo@@ pe@@ z, and J@@ ami@@ e F@@ ox@@ x as Nathani@@ el An@@ th@@ ony A@@ y@@ ers, the J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained dou@@ ble bas@@ sis@@ t whose promis@@ ing career was cut short by a trag@@ ic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ ano@@ id schizophren@@ i@@ a."
"E@@ very time I am home I am confron@@ ted with the usual sources of irrit@@ ation for most Nigeri@@ ans@@ : our failed in@@ fras@@ tru@@ ctu@@ re, our failed government, but also by the incredible resili@@ ence of people who thri@@ ve despite the government, rather than because of it."
"@@ The question is, wh@@ y?"
But a gene turns on that actually fu@@ ses those together.
And one of the things that often gets lost in discus@@ sions of depression is that you know it's ridicul@@ ous.
We aren't machin@@ es.
"As you can see here, we've color@@ -@@ co@@ ded all the bio@@ molecules bro@@ wn."
"@@ And because depression symptoms are in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble, it's hard to know who might look fine but is actually strugg@@ l@@ ing."
"@@ These are called vol@@ ati@@ le organic comp@@ oun@@ ds, and we release hundre@@ ds, even thousands of them every time we exhal@@ e."
You know Vi@@ en@@ nese audi@@ ences usually don't inter@@ f@@ ere with the music.
"@@ So it means that you have to be able to deal with very weak signals, and that means that your device has to be very sensi@@ tive."
A@@ sy@@ lu@@ m see@@ kers are people who present themselves at a bor@@ der and say that they'll be per@@ secu@@ ted if they're sent back home.
So here we are.
"@@ There's one more thing you can do to protect yourself from experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer@@ 's, even if you have the full@@ -@@ blo@@ wn disease path@@ ology ab@@ la@@ ze in your brain."
"@@ And I said, ""But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here."
One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autis@@ m.
In@@ stead it's about understanding the fit between your characteristics and what would make you good a certain job.
And you can think of it in terms of a gam@@ e-@@ theor@@ e@@ tic pay@@ off matr@@ ix@@ .
"@@ We thought that maybe nitric o@@ xide affected cell death, and how cells surviv@@ e, and their resistance to other things."
"@@ What if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out, wo@@ w, here are the 17 molecules that have alter@@ ed in this brain tissue that has been under@@ going epile@@ ps@@ y or changing in Parkinson@@ 's disease or otherwise being alter@@ ed@@ ?"
This is more than an invit@@ ation. S@@ pre@@ ad the wor@@ d.
Co@@ ast is clear -- now she's ready to play.
It would have to have domin@@ ion over all of our world.
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he@@ ?
"@@ Now that is less than a year old, in an oper@@ ating room."

"@@ So when we look out into the solar system, where are the possibili@@ ti@@ es?"
"""@@ What do you mean, '@@ fat dan@@ cer@@ s@@ ?@@ ' Li@@ ke, size 10, size 12 kind of fat@@ ?"
But there are other barri@@ ers.
I knew nothing about cancer.
OK@@ ?
I know I want to ra@@ ft the ri@@ ver again.
So this personaliz@@ ation is something that one can then build by having the virtu@@ e of large number@@ s.
"Re@@ g@@ is@@ ter, for example."
"@@ I'm a social psycholog@@ ist. I study pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e, and I teach at a competi@@ tive business school, so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynam@@ ic@@ s."
So take a moment and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self for something that you know today will be a little bit har@@ d.
"Per@@ haps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the U.S. healthcare system, particularly in the end@@ -of-@@ life care, is as simple as a shift in perspective, and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death."
"@@ He says, ""O@@ f course they do. They go in the order in which they were buil@@ t."
"T@@ E: W@@ an@@ ting to take reven@@ ge is a very human emotion -- instin@@ ctu@@ al, ev@@ en."
This is not a person that is being studied at auto@@ psy@@ .
"L@@ T: It didn't even start by people contribu@@ ting co@@ de, it was more that people started contribu@@ ting ideas."
G@@ et in control of your stress before it takes control of you.
Th@@ ink of the number of blind people.
"@@ When our sin@@ uses are infec@@ ted, our immune response he@@ ats up the area, ro@@ as@@ ting the bacteria and inflam@@ ing the ca@@ vi@@ ties well past their usual siz@@ e."
They simply go through their lives getting on with it.
"Al@@ ready in medicine, bi@@ of@@ abri@@ ca@@ tion techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body part@@ s, like ear@@ s, win@@ d@@ pi@@ pes, skin@@ , blood vessels and bon@@ e, that have been success@@ fully implan@@ ted into patients."
"@@ They are flexible enough that they can be fol@@ ded to fit into the ca@@ the@@ ter, so the doctor can im@@ plant it directly on top of the tumor with minim@@ ally inv@@ asi@@ ve surger@@ y."
But I was really interested to see what happens in your brain when you pay cover@@ t attention.
"I@@ f they're talking about having lost a family member@@ , don't start talking about the time you lost a family member@@ ."
A@@ re they making mon@@ ey@@ ?
"I@@ f you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk -- the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m is R@@ AS@@ A, which is the S@@ ans@@ k@@ r@@ it word for ""@@ ju@@ ice@@ "" or ""@@ essen@@ ce@@ ."""
You can't roll a stop sign in Cam@@ bridge without h@@ itting a graduate stud@@ ent.
"@@ Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States."
Because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it.
And further research into phantom lim@@ bs is@@ n@@ ’t just applica@@ ble to the people who experience them.
S@@ he's very fabul@@ ous.
"@@ You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. ele@@ gan@@ s -- which probably most of you haven't seen one -- you can tell they're old -- isn't that interest@@ ing?"
Th@@ ey're just re@@ lent@@ less and obses@@ sive about what they do.

"@@ So until only very recently in our evolutionary history, there was har@@ dly a need to learn how to come home from war, because we never really did."
How many human lives might have been saved if this veterin@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E@@ .@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and cardio@@ log@@ ist@@ s?
"@@ Now, you notice that there is not the sligh@@ test doubt in my mind that this is going to work, if you look at my face, right?"
"@@ So we've got tri@@ ple the space, but we've become such good shop@@ per@@ s that we need even more space."
"@@ But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand th@@ an, say, high chol@@ ester@@ ol@@ ."
We@@ 'd go back to the begin@@ ning.
just happen@@ ed.
There's something even more star@@ t@@ ling happen@@ ing.
"@@ So you need to find the right nutri@@ ents, the warm@@ th, the hu@@ mid@@ ity and all the nice environments to make them thri@@ ve."
"A@@ ll right, if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual the@@ ft is true, any species that ac@@ qui@@ res it should show an explos@@ ion of creativity and prosper@@ ity."
There are two different ways you can spot whether some data has gone mis@@ s@@ ing.
"@@ (Laughter) ""@@ That Satur@@ day when you wondered where I was, well, I was getting your r@@ ing."
And this is a bir@@ d on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.
"@@ This diag@@ ra@@ m shows the body's ly@@ mp@@ ha@@ tic system, which has evolved to meet this nee@@ d."
"I@@ magine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test, a lab techni@@ ci@@ an extrac@@ ts a total RN@@ A, which is quite simple today, and puts it in a standard 9@@ 6@@ -@@ well pl@@ ate like this one."
"@@ So these have been cali@@ bra@@ ted to your level of exper@@ ti@@ se, because we want this to be difficul@@ t, and I'll tell you why, moment@@ ar@@ il@@ y."
The women in this room are lo@@ tu@@ ses in a sea of fi@@ re.
"S@@ ince we've launched the program@@ , three million tri@@ ps have been ta@@ k@@ en."
"N@@ umber n@@ ine@@ : This is not the last one, but it is the most important one."
But is there a positive way to think about this?
"@@ He called up the local news@@ paper, he got the interest of an investiga@@ tive journal@@ ist, and that journal@@ ist actually found the real rap@@ ist, a man who ultimately confes@@ sed to this ra@@ pe, a man who was thought to have committed 50 rap@@ es in that area, and when this information was given to the jud@@ ge, the judge set Titus fre@@ e."
(Applause)
"@@ So the neurogenes@@ is rate will decrease as we get ol@@ der, but it is still occurr@@ ing."
"@@ And dead zon@@ es will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to mer@@ ge, and we can imagine something like the dead@@ -@@ zon@@ ifica@@ tion of the global, coas@@ tal ocean."

And I didn't ask them to do nice carto@@ ons.
And so that didn't work.
Not working either@@ .
So we never ad@@ vise veter@@ ans to turn off cau@@ tion comple@@ tel@@ y.
And what Bay@@ es showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

"@@ Now, I've given you a few examples of how language can profoundly shape the way we think, and it does so in a variety of ways."

(Laughter) (Applause) But the six@@ th-@@ grad@@ ers demand it.
So let's take this a little fur@@ ther@@ .
"@@ I want to walk you through it, it's pretty ast@@ oun@@ ding."
"@@ The research that my laboratory has been doing, that econom@@ ists and psychologists around the country have been doing, has reve@@ aled something really quite star@@ t@@ ling to us, something we call the ""@@ impact bias@@ ,"" which is the ten@@ den@@ cy for the simul@@ ator to work bad@@ ly, for the simul@@ ator to make you believe that different out@@ comes are more different th@@ an, in fact, they really are."
I went across and kno@@ cked on Con@@ ni@@ e's do@@ or.

"I@@ t can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells, and better yet, there is no ha@@ ir to remo@@ ve, no scar@@ s or insec@@ t's bit@@ es, and no was@@ te."
"S@@ econ@@ d, you have 30 minutes to solve thes@@ e; are you taking the entire 30 minutes or are you giving up before the 30 minutes el@@ ap@@ se@@ ?"
And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avo@@ iding the lea@@ p from step three to step four@@ .
"@@ What is the problem, in your own wor@@ d@@ s?"
(Applause) This includes not treating pregn@@ ant women like community proper@@ ty.
"A@@ ny case, I went on, I soldi@@ ered on with psychiatr@@ y, and found myself training in Brita@@ in in some of the best hospitals in this country. I was very privi@@ le@@ ge@@ d."
"(@@ V@@ ideo) Ch@@ im@@ am@@ anda A@@ di@@ chi@@ e: The single story creates stereo@@ ty@@ pes, and the problem with stereo@@ types is not that they are un@@ true, but that they are in@@ comple@@ te."

To@@ tally predic@@ table.
And you have to re@@ apply it every two to four hour@@ s.
"Bas@@ ically for the amount of money that we spen@@ d, we can do X amount of good in treatment, and 10 times as much good in preven@@ tion."

"S@@ ome@@ times, soon after giving bir@@ th, some women become depres@@ sed, and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psycho@@ tic."
"@@ We all heard you pe@@ e."""

And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong sum@@ mit of the py@@ ram@@ id ...
"I@@ t suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it shoul@@ d."
It's a place where people have the long@@ est dis@@ abil@@ it@@ y-@@ free life expectancy in the world.

"@@ When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own ver@@ sions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had@@ ."

"@@ Now, there's a reason why this test hasn't been up@@ da@@ ted in over six deca@@ des@@ ."

""@@ "F@@ or two minu@@ tes@@ ,"" you say, ""I want you to stand like this, and it's going to make you feel more power@@ ful@@ ."""
"@@ So he was pretty sto@@ ked, and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on ""O@@ pr@@ ah@@ "" with his big discover@@ y."
"@@ And if cro@@ ps don't adap@@ t to climate change, neither will agricul@@ ture, neither will we@@ ."
"BG: Ander@@ s, I'm a for@@ mer journal@@ ist, and to me, it's amazing that in the current climate of s@@ las@@ hing bud@@ gets and publis@@ h@@ ers in crisis, D@@ ag@@ b@@ la@@ de@@ t has consen@@ ted so many resources for this story, which tells a lot about news@@ papers taking the responsibil@@ ity, but how did you sell it to your edit@@ or@@ s?"

"@@ And you know the reason why, of course."
"@@ And actually, the answer is probably no@@ t. There are lots of descri@@ p@@ tions of adolesc@@ ence in history that sound very similar to the descri@@ p@@ tions we use today."

What happened next really came to define my entire experience of medical trau@@ ma.
"T@@ o understand the phenomenon of color, it helps to think about light as a wa@@ ve."
"@@ Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time."

The third number is what we're looking for.

"O@@ n@@ e, two, three, go@@ !"
"@@ And we included a unique mat@@ ching system where if Mi@@ ke@@ 's first victi@@ m had come for@@ ward, saved her record, entered into the mat@@ ching system and named Mi@@ ke, and Mi@@ ke@@ 's second victi@@ m had done the same thing a few months later, they would have mat@@ ched and the ver@@ i@@ fied contact information of both surviv@@ ors would have been sent to the auth@@ ori@@ ties at the same time for investiga@@ tion and follow up."
(Laughter) and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves be@@ er.
So we need to think about that.
And so that's how this all oper@@ at@@ es.
"@@ (Laughter) (Applause) I mean, the loss of vir@@ gin@@ ity is usually a process that involves ..."
"S@@ am is 15 years old. H@@ is par@@ ents, Scott Ber@@ ns and L@@ es@@ lie Gor@@ don@@ , both physici@@ ans, are here with us this morning as well."

And indeed we started to be surprised right away.
"@@ He found several very important interac@@ tions, and so we replica@@ ted this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-@@ drug interac@@ tions."
And now they are close as can be.
"@@ So that ran@@ ges from heart disease, to malari@@ a, HIV@@ , AID@@ S, as well as other forms of cancer -- any@@ thing."
So I went out and I started with the kids.
What is it that we have that no other animal has@@ ?
"@@ So I got the Spanish transla@@ tion of ""H@@ ar@@ ry Po@@ t@@ ter@@ "" and started read@@ ing, and sure enough, I didn't understand almost anything at the beginning, but I kept on reading because I loved the book, and by the end of the book, I was able to follow it almost without any problems."
(Laughter) It's a very good example.
M@@ eta@@ -@@ narra@@ tives that make universal claim@@ s failed us in the 20@@ th century and are fail@@ ing us in the 21@@ st@@ .
"@@ It's all about genetic enhan@@ cem@@ ent, it's not about therapeu@@ tics."

"@@ Now, what does that mean@@ ?"
We can determine whether that seems to be true.
"@@ And that's true, your little an@@ ge@@ l may not be sexting because only 3@@ 3 percent of 16@@ - and 17@@ -year-@@ olds are sex@@ ting."
"@@ When this huge base of mobile shop@@ per@@ s me@@ ets with ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ ted eco@@ systems, chemical reactions happen."

"@@ And this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innov@@ ations."
"@@ So the most common form of gi@@ anti@@ s@@ m is a condition called ac@@ rome@@ gal@@ y, and ac@@ rome@@ gal@@ y is caused by a ben@@ ign tumor on your p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary g@@ land that causes an over@@ production of human growth hormon@@ e."
We took our Mon@@ et prin@@ ts to the hospit@@ al.

"I@@ t makes me really feel that that civiliz@@ ation -- which, as I say, if you believe the scientific creation story, has emer@@ ged pu@@ rely as a result of the laws of physic@@ s, and a few hydro@@ gen atoms -- then I think, to me any@@ way, it makes me feel incredibly valu@@ able."
What we're looking at now -- I'm going to add in the community of some people with C. dif@@ f@@ .
"@@ And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happi@@ er, more protec@@ tive life today, but it will protect your brain from in@@ cur@@ able diseas@@ es."

"@@ I mean, we obviously see it on the be@@ ach@@ es, but that's not even your main concer@@ n."
"I@@ f you change this hormone path@@ way in fli@@ es, they live long@@ er."

"@@ And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilu@@ te the medicine is, they say, the more powerful it is."
And I'm going to just talk very brief@@ ly about two kinds of biological pollu@@ tion: one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutri@@ ents.
We need to swal@@ low our pr@@ ide@@ .
"@@ And so in order to be able to access the brain, you really need to dedica@@ te your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscien@@ ti@@ st to get access to these tool@@ s."

"B@@ y that time, my st@@ af@@ f pou@@ red into my offic@@ e."
"@@ We@@ 'd already set up this kind of capacity for L@@ as@@ sa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is out@@ stand@@ ing."
"@@ But any remaining pan@@ ic subsi@@ ded as I walked into the cour@@ tro@@ om and looked around at a sea of friend@@ ly fac@@ es: our individual women cli@@ ents who had shared their deeply personal stories, the gene@@ tici@@ st@@ s who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their busy care@@ ers to dedica@@ te themselves to this fight and represent@@ ativ@@ es from a di@@ verse arra@@ y of medi@@ cal@@ , patient advoca@@ cy, environmental and religious organiz@@ ations, who had sub@@ mit@@ ted friend of the court bri@@ efs in the case."
The reason why I don't believe that tells us that the Neander@@ th@@ als had language is -- here's a simple analog@@ y: F@@ err@@ ar@@ is are cars that have eng@@ in@@ es.
"U@@ p to the age of 2@@ 1, he thought he didn't have the language gene and he could not speak another language."
"@@ Now, you can run some numbers and that happens to be quite an as@@ ton@@ ishing number@@ ."

"L@@ adi@@ es and gentle@@ men, I'm James R@@ an@@ di, and I'm wait@@ ing."

"B@@ y using this tool over and over and simul@@ ating out@@ come after out@@ come, people can understand that the invest@@ ments and savings that they under@@ take today determine their well-@@ being in the future."

"@@ And so what this is, is we're taking a cros@@ s-@@ section of her body here, and you can see in the middle there is her heart, and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will inv@@ ade and will kill her, un@@ tre@@ ated, in a matter of wee@@ ks."
We didn't push the limit@@ ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.

"@@ So our bodies can change how far away that finish line loo@@ ks, but people who had committed to a manag@@ e@@ able goal that they could accompl@@ ish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easi@@ er."
"@@ So I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classi@@ fy types of predi@@ ca@@ ments, types of situ@@ ations, types of obstac@@ les and also to classi@@ fy available and possible ways to think and pair them up."

"@@ So you keep hearing about machine learning and there was a revolution of machine learning recently, in deep learning, and that allowed us to build mach@@ ine@@ -@@ learning models that can understand wireless signals and interpre@@ t them so they would know what happened in the environment."

(Applause)
"@@ Well, Mark T@@ wa@@ in certainly thought so."

"@@ What followed is a n@@ ine@@ -year period that can best be ti@@ t@@ led as ""D@@ eni@@ al and R@@ un@@ ning@@ ."""
We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.
"@@ I already suffer from anxiety, but the pan@@ ic attac@@ ks I had pri@@ or to re@@ turning to work were un@@ bear@@ able@@ ."""
"S@@ cien@@ tists found something called the g@@ ly@@ mp@@ ha@@ tic system, a cle@@ an-@@ up mechanism that remo@@ ves this buil@@ du@@ p and is much more active when we're as@@ le@@ ep@@ ."
I wanted a reg@@ is@@ tered retirement savings plan that would keep me in can@@ dy long enough to make old age swe@@ et.
"@@ (Laughter) But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms -- for instance, high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in colle@@ ge."
"@@ Good people could be sedu@@ ced across that line, and under good and some rare circumstanc@@ es, bad kids could recover with hel@@ p, with re@@ form, with rehabilit@@ ation."
"@@ I must say that before I went to the U.S@@ ., I didn't consciously identify as Afric@@ an."
"@@ And actually, there is an important prece@@ d@@ ent for such a pa@@ use from the 1970@@ s, when scientists got together to call for a moratori@@ um on the use of molecular cl@@ on@@ ing, until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and val@@ ida@@ ted."
"@@ That prison@@ er covered himself with sh@@ it every day, they had to roll him in dir@@ t so he wouldn't stin@@ k."
"@@ But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food pur@@ ve@@ y@@ ors and the restaur@@ ant indus@@ try, and over a five, si@@ x, seven year period we@@ an of us off the extreme amounts of f@@ at, sugar and all the other non-@@ food ingredi@@ ents."
"@@ And when those people come into the world, they demand more food, they demand a whole series of things and they live closer together."
So there are two really remarkable things about this.
Or is it obser@@ ver@@ -@@ rela@@ tiv@@ e?
The first one is that not all media are created equ@@ al.
"M@@ ost of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hin@@ d@@ si@@ ght is anything but 20@@ /@@ 20@@ ."
"@@ Now in Arab@@ ic, we can make this defin@@ ite by ad@@ ding the defin@@ ite article ""@@ al@@ ."""
"O@@ ka@@ y so, in my world, what do we need to do?"
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going aroun@@ d.
"@@ There are nearly 100 sub@@ types of HIV@@ , with new sub@@ types being discovered regul@@ ar@@ ly."
"@@ So I didn't know what to do, I was at a los@@ s."
"S@@ ome of them turn out to be lead@@ ers, but not all of them."
"@@ We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together."
But the truth li@@ es.
"@@ The arro@@ ws indica@@ te pea@@ k gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex@@ . You can see that that pea@@ k happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls, and that's probably because boys go through puber@@ ty a couple of years later than girls on average, and then during adolescen@@ ce, there's a significant de@@ cl@@ ine in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex@@ ."
"@@ Now, if you fli@@ p without telling the monkey the dimen@@ sions that each brain has to control, like this guy is controlling x and y, but he should be controlling now y and z, inst@@ an@@ tane@@ ously, that anim@@ al@@ 's brain for@@ gets about the old dimen@@ sions and it starts concentr@@ ating on the new dimension@@ s."
"@@ Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here."
The same hormones that create mood and motiv@@ ation in us are in those brains as well.
And this -- this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationshi@@ p.
It's a broken system.
"As it is in my culture, once you reach puber@@ ty stage, you are supposed to go to initi@@ ation camp@@ s."
"N@@ ex@@ t, we need proper science, proper evid@@ ence."
"In@@ de@@ ed, this was the first real conversation I'd had about my opio@@ id therapy, perio@@ d."
"U@@ sing the Internet, I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer, and what I had found sho@@ cked me."
"@@ So my sugges@@ tion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking fun@@ ny, because you might just find the question that you've been looking for."
(Laughter) And I would want to do that like that.
"I@@ n fact, only six percent of assaul@@ ts reported to the police end with the assa@@ il@@ ant spending a single day in pris@@ on."
"Un@@ fortunately, we also have a ""@@ dis@@ figured is bad@@ "" stereo@@ ty@@ pe."
"I@@ f you look at movi@@ es such as ""The M@@ atr@@ ix@@ ,"" ""M@@ e@@ tro@@ pol@@ is@@ ,"" ""The Ter@@ min@@ ator@@ ,"" shows such as ""W@@ est@@ world@@ ,"" they all speak of this kind of fe@@ ar."
"A crucial neural transpor@@ t protein called ""@@ tau@@ "" becomes hyper@@ ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ y@@ la@@ ted and tw@@ ists itself into something called ""@@ tan@@ g@@ les@@ ,"" which cho@@ ke off the neurons from the in@@ side."
"@@ You take an area, a school, a dis@@ tric@@ t, you change the conditions, give people a different sense of possi@@ bil@@ ity, a different set of expecta@@ tions, a bro@@ a@@ der range of opportuni@@ ties, you ch@@ er@@ ish and value the relationships between teachers and lear@@ ner@@ s, you offer people the discre@@ tion to be creative and to innov@@ ate in what they do, and schools that were once b@@ ere@@ ft spr@@ ing to life."
(Laughter) On@@ ce in a while we get a lea@@ der out of there.
"E@@ very No@@ vem@@ ber@@ , tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50@@ ,000@@ -@@ word nov@@ el, from scrat@@ ch, in 30 day@@ s."

"I@@ f you say, ""@@ there's an eleph@@ ant in the room@@ ,"" there isn't an actual one, looking for the pe@@ an@@ ut dis@@ h on the table."
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brother@@ s.
We see curios@@ ity in the youn@@ g.
"@@ What this is actually saying, is that many of these decisions are not resid@@ ing within us."
But there was a pretty big problem with this.
"@@ Now, we can all re@@ late to this in our own experience."
My grand@@ father committed suicide by pois@@ on@@ ing.
"@@ The second are C@@ as, or “@@ CRISP@@ R@@ -@@ associ@@ ate@@ d@@ ” proteins which cho@@ p up DNA like molecular s@@ cis@@ sor@@ s."
"@@ When he says, ""C@@ ome to me that I might feed your f@@ les@@ h to the birds of the heav@@ ens and the be@@ as@@ ts of the fiel@@ d@@ ,"" the phr@@ ase ""@@ come to me@@ "" is a hin@@ t also of his vulner@@ ability."
"@@ So as you can see, this is a fr@@ ustrat@@ ing topic for me, and I really try to understand@@ : Why the re@@ lu@@ c@@ tan@@ ce to protect and support indigenous health systems and security system@@ s?"
What does he have to say all these years later about it?
"G@@ abri@@ el Gar@@ cía M@@ ár@@ que@@ z is one of my favorite writ@@ ers, for his storytell@@ ing, but even more, I think, for the beauty and preci@@ sion of his pros@@ e."
"O@@ n@@ ce those bits of DNA have been inser@@ ted into the bacterial chromos@@ ome, the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RN@@ A, which is orange in this picture, that is an exact replica@@ te of the viral DNA."
"I@@ n tur@@ n, these mon@@ om@@ ers were bon@@ ded into long poly@@ mer cha@@ ins to make plastic in the form of millions of pe@@ lle@@ ts."
"S@@ o, mun@@ dan@@ e sounds can be really interesting -- if you pay attention."
You've got to extract gener@@ aliz@@ ations so you can produce and understand new senten@@ ces.
"@@ We know that the rate of technological change is acceler@@ ating, which is for@@ cing our brains to reac@@ t."
"@@ The s@@ now and the ice were my sand@@ box, and the Inu@@ it were my teach@@ ers."
"N@@ o, the music pus@@ hed me over, which is why I call it one-@@ but@@ to@@ ck play@@ ing."
"A million brains, OK, now we're tal@@ king."
"D@@ espite this being a big human tra@@ it, however, we know relatively little about when and how we come to care about the opinion of others."
It's like people are sa@@ iling into a head@@ win@@ d all the time.
"S@@ o, can you visu@@ alize that?"
"@@ read@@ y, just play some time."
"@@ The first concern is about corrup@@ tion, and the concern that people in these sett@@ ings are corrup@@ t and they are un@@ trus@@ t@@ wor@@ th@@ y."
So I challeng@@ ed her to get some data.

"@@ And so members of my team immediately went out and jo@@ ined Dr. Hu@@ mar@@ r K@@ han and his team there, and we set up diagnos@@ tics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the bor@@ der and into Si@@ erra Le@@ one."
This is social mo@@ bil@@ ity.
"@@ (Laughter) Th@@ ink of it. 1,@@ 600 people, busy people, involved in all sorts of different things, listen@@ ing, understanding and being moved by a piece by Ch@@ op@@ in."

"@@ The only mistake is if I'm not awar@@ e, if each individual musici@@ an is not aware and accep@@ ting enough of his fellow band member to incorpor@@ ate the idea and we don't allow for creativ@@ ity."
"Al@@ ba@@ tr@@ os@@ ses frequ@@ ently fly si@@ x, sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one me@@ al, one big me@@ al, to their ch@@ ick who is waiting for them."
"@@ The research I have shared with you today suggests that this ability emer@@ ges very early in development, before we can even ut@@ ter a complete sent@@ ence or are even pot@@ ty-@@ traine@@ d."
"O@@ ver the last couple of years, we've seen a real push towards greater transpar@@ ency when it comes to company own@@ er@@ shi@@ p."
A metaphor isn't true or un@@ true in any ordinary sense.
It's actually not that surprising they were cau@@ gh@@ t.
"@@ Now despite this history of dis@@ trus@@ t, I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research."
"@@ So brain research has shown that the adoles@@ cent brain under@@ goes really quite profound development, and this has implications for education, for rehabilit@@ ation, and interven@@ tion. The environment, including teach@@ ing, can and does shape the developing adoles@@ cent brain, and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been rou@@ tin@@ ely educa@@ ting teenagers in the W@@ est."
This is 2@@ 2@@ -year-old Mouaz Al Bal@@ k@@ hi from Syri@@ a.
But there's gon@@ na be bad news some@@ where@@ .
We must dis@@ sent from the in@@ differen@@ ce.
"S@@ o, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utili@@ ze it has appe@@ al, because of its relative simpli@@ city."
"@@ They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it, and that the@@ y, A@@ non@@ ym@@ ous, are the auth@@ enti@@ c voice of resistance -- be it against Mid@@ dle Eas@@ tern dic@@ tat@@ or@@ shi@@ ps, against global media corpor@@ ations, or against intelligence ag@@ enci@@ es, or who@@ ever it is."
"O@@ n J@@ une 12@@ , 2014, precisely at 3@@ :@@ 3@@ 3 in a bal@@ my winter after@@ no@@ on in S@@ ã@@ o P@@ au@@ lo, Braz@@ il, a typical South American winter after@@ no@@ on, this kid, this young man that you see celebr@@ ating here like he had sco@@ red a go@@ al, Juliano P@@ in@@ to, 29 years old, accompl@@ ished a magni@@ fic@@ ent de@@ ed."
So it's really interest@@ ing.
"@@ Well, all of us here, I'll be@@ t, had some great teach@@ ers."
That's what that ar@@ row mean@@ s.
We have discre@@ te data element@@ s; we don't have a time function on them.
"@@ And the same time, he is sending a mental message to the second r@@ at that didn't see any light, and the second rat@@ , in 70 percent of the times is going to press the left le@@ ver and get a re@@ ward without ever experiencing the light in the retin@@ a."
There's some evidence that they do.
"D@@ ad, that doesn't look fair@@ ."
So our way to solve this is to build the space of words.
"I@@ n fact, there's probably not one single answer."
That hasn't changed in over 150 years.
"@@ And the implications of this -- there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loop@@ s."
But es@@ tro@@ gen and testoster@@ one play important roles in shap@@ ing features that we find at@@ tr@@ activ@@ e.
"O@@ ur project was a shock for many Russi@@ ans, who used to think that our country has always been an auto@@ cra@@ tic emp@@ ire and the ideas of freedom and democracy could never have prev@@ ai@@ led, just because democracy was not our destin@@ y."
"I@@ t became clear to me sh@@ e, too, was a victi@@ m of the polic@@ y."
"I@@ n a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-@@ being is deeply ti@@ ed to the well-@@ being of others."
S@@ he's about to let me know she's too frustra@@ ted with me.
"@@ That's what happens in academic jour@@ n@@ als, it's what happens at academic confer@@ ences -- the Q@@ &amp;@@ A ses@@ sion after a post@@ do@@ c pres@@ ents data is often a bloo@@ d@@ ba@@ th."
"@@ But by comparis@@ on, we can learn@@ ."
"@@ But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any auth@@ ority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they want."
"S@@ he said, ""@@ K@@ I@@ N@@ D@@ L@@ Y CO@@ M@@ P@@ L@@ Y W@@ I@@ T@@ H M@@ Y B@@ AN@@ K@@ E@@ R@@ S I@@ N@@ S@@ TR@@ UC@@ T@@ I@@ ON@@ S@@ ."
"P@@ lay enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snow@@ boar@@ d, fly a plan@@ e, drive a n@@ ine@@ -@@ second quar@@ ter mi@@ le, or kill a man."
They fit together in a path@@ way.
But exces@@ sive reli@@ ance on incentiv@@ es de@@ mor@@ aliz@@ es professional activity in two sen@@ ses of that wor@@ d.
Vis@@ ion is the most important and prioritiz@@ ed sense that we have.
"@@ So in a lectu@@ re-@@ based class, half the students are above that level and half are be@@ low@@ ."
"@@ So it smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly trac@@ ks me as I move around the fr@@ ame, and it's rob@@ ust to a wide variety of changes in size, pos@@ e, for@@ ward, back@@ war@@ d."
These mal@@ adi@@ es come for us all.
I didn't want to tell my grandmother because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere I shouldn't have be@@ en.
"@@ This bar@@ ra@@ ge of negativ@@ ity is what we're up again@@ st@@ : the crus@@ hing statis@@ tics, the viol@@ ence, the mental health ris@@ ks, the well-@@ meaning but f@@ law@@ ed response my parents gave me when I came out, that they didn't want me to have a harder life."
W@@ as it me or the teach@@ er@@ ?
"@@ And even if you graduate from high school, if you're low-@@ in@@ come, you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever comple@@ ting a college degre@@ e."
"@@ Now I'm not suggesting we en@@ do@@ w crimin@@ als with super@@ power@@ s, but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior, for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us."
But knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depres@@ sed.
And I suddenly realized some@@ thing: that I was completely in the dar@@ k.
"@@ (Music) The 10@@ -year-@@ old, on every eight no@@ t@@ es."
Wh@@ o are these characters who are so dam@@ n happ@@ y?
"I@@ n just a two-@@ minute sp@@ an of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually re@@ w@@ ire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimis@@ tically and more success@@ ful@@ ly."
"@@ And when we assu@@ me that privacy is impossible in digital media, we completely write off and ex@@ c@@ use her boy@@ friend@@ 's bad, bad behavior."
"@@ What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sic@@ k, but where you go to get health@@ y."
"@@ Y@@ et when it came to a disease like diabetes that k@@ ills Americans eight times more frequ@@ ently than me@@ lan@@ oma, I never once ques@@ tioned the conven@@ tional wis@@ dom."
"@@ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy, the R@@ ever@@ end Th@@ omas Bay@@ es, who was a sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and mathema@@ tici@@ an in the 18@@ th centur@@ y."
"@@ I left San Francisco, where I live, on Mon@@ day, and I was getting on the plane for this confer@@ ence."
"@@ And the third is, they de@@ volve responsibility to the school level for getting the job don@@ e."
It's ris@@ k. It's rewar@@ d. It's random@@ ness.
"H@@ ave a go: Poem 1: L@@ it@@ tle F@@ ly / Th@@ y sum@@ mer@@ 's play, / My though@@ t@@ less hand / H@@ as br@@ us@@ h@@ 'd away."
So that's one way of going about it.
"@@ W@@ e've got ourselves in a world that's mas@@ sively complex@@ , and we've been using algorithms to kind of fil@@ ter it down so we can navi@@ gate through it."
So how does it work@@ ?
"@@ But since we are on@@ stage, Chris challeng@@ ed me."
It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bag@@ s lef@@ t.
(Laughter) I know so man@@ y.
"@@ But recently, we've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersec@@ t, from creating sigh@@ t-@@ specific audio and video inst@@ all@@ ation to engineering interac@@ tive concer@@ ts."
"B@@ ut, sorry, by the time they're ol@@ der, od@@ ds are they will be sex@@ ting."
"@@ And this is Amy N@@ g, a magaz@@ ine edit@@ or turned ill@@ ustrat@@ or, entrepren@@ eur@@ , teacher and creative director@@ ."

But opportunity is no@@ t.
"@@ There's always a moment where they try to tu@@ g your heart@@ str@@ ings, and this was it for So@@ lo@@ mon@@ ."
"@@ Because you are, aren't you@@ ?"
And we know this happened -- wh@@ y?
"@@ Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you -- she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the tele@@ phone, she doesn't even go there in person, and you have to wait up to two years because she's boo@@ ked ahead that amount of time."
"@@ And we think that might be because adolesc@@ ents and adults use a different mental approach, a different cognitive strateg@@ y, to make social decision@@ s, and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies where@@ by we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral tas@@ k, and I'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab@@ ."
"@@ (Applause) We even pas@@ ted on Israel@@ i military to@@ w@@ ers, and nothing happened."

"O@@ h, that's it."
"@@ So you're fol@@ ding up, you're making yourself sm@@ all."
"@@ So we said, ""Why can't we get their numbers and text them@@ ?"""
"L@@ S: One of my favorite quo@@ tes in psychology comes from the social psycholog@@ ist So@@ lo@@ m@@ on As@@ ch, and he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove the ve@@ il of self-@@ evidence from things."
I think that's the only way to look at it.
"@@ But then she said something that I'd never heard before, and that is that it gave her control over her life and over her health."
"@@ And there are other examples of these kinds of animals, like tur@@ ns, certain kinds of birds are like this."
So we have this thing called ambi@@ ent inti@@ mac@@ y.
You struggled to fun@@ nel your way through these call@@ s.
"@@ And if they do that often enough, they not only can pass a test but it will be easier for them to pass their cour@@ ses, and they might even finish college, which has a huge impact on their future ear@@ ning potenti@@ al."
The bad news is they're extin@@ c@@ t.
I believe that tal@@ ent and intelligence are equally distributed throughout the world.
"Con@@ sider this: Star@@ ting right here at the conven@@ tion cent@@ er, we can find the near@@ by aqu@@ ari@@ um, we can look at where we're sit@@ ting, and then we can cru@@ ise up the co@@ ast to the big aqu@@ ari@@ um, the oce@@ an, and Californi@@ a's four national marine san@@ ctu@@ ari@@ es, and the new network of state marine reser@@ ves that are beginning to protect and rest@@ ore some of the as@@ sets We can fli@@ t over to Hawai@@ i and see the real Hawai@@ ian Is@@ land@@ s: not just the little bit that po@@ kes through the surfac@@ e, but also what's be@@ low@@ ."

"@@ We're starting to have a bottom@@ -up approach where we're identi@@ fying those genes, those prote@@ ins, those molecules, understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work, understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work, and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior, and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cogni@@ tion."
"I@@ f you see, if you hear@@ , if you feel@@ , if you're aware of anything, you are consci@@ ous, and they are consci@@ ous."
"@@ And as D@@ an Bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health."

(Laughter) H@@ ave you come across this ide@@ a?
"@@ Now, the beauty of lingu@@ istic diversity is that it reve@@ als to us just how ing@@ eni@@ ous and how flexible the human mind is."
This was what we called the meaningful condi@@ tion.

Not one more frag@@ ile infant should have to go directly from the incu@@ bat@@ or to day care because his parents have used up all of their me@@ ag@@ er time sitting in the NI@@ C@@ U@@ .

"@@ But things have change@@ d, and now, standing here as a climate activ@@ ist, I ask you all to become one, too."
The brain doesn't feel pain@@ .
"@@ So if we want to be able to prevent epidemic@@ s like E@@ bola, we need to take on the risk of invest@@ ing in vaccine development and in sto@@ ck@@ p@@ ile cre@@ ation."

"@@ (Laughter) I sear@@ che@@ d, ""How do I overcome the fear of rejec@@ tion@@ ?"""
"@@ And this is a sche@@ matic of a bi@@ or@@ e@@ ac@@ tor we're developing in our lab to help engineer tissu@@ es in a more mo@@ dul@@ ar, scal@@ able way."
And then it has detec@@ tors on its back so it can sense how much star@@ light or mo@@ on@@ light is h@@ itting its back.
"@@ I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the work@@ force, who don't feel that some@@ times."

"@@ The only thing we can do, what we know, from the time we're born, we just hold the g@@ un and kill@@ ."
"@@ Well, I don't think so."
M@@ ore people.

"@@ The unique arran@@ g@@ ement of these atoms gives epine@@ phr@@ ine its identi@@ ty, but nobody has ever actually seen one of these, because they're very small, so we're going to call this an artistic impres@@ sion, and I want to explain to you how small this is."
"@@ So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being inv@@ aded and our way of life is going to change, and everything will -- And the problem is that if this had been properly manag@@ ed, if people had been properly recei@@ ved, wel@@ come@@ d, shel@@ tered at point of entr@@ y, screen@@ ed at point of entr@@ y, and the moved by plane to different European countries, this would not have scared people."
Th@@ en they promote the win@@ ner@@ s.

"@@ You transmit a wireless signal to the sky, it reflects off some air@@ plan@@ e, comes back to you, and you start detec@@ ting these air@@ plan@@ es."

"@@ And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laun@@ dry at home, or they have to bring the laun@@ dry away to a stream far off."
"@@ So far, we haven't changed our brain's destin@@ y."
These changes weren't happening in a vac@@ u@@ um.
What you've done makes people lau@@ gh and then thin@@ k.
It's made by a bacteri@@ a.
Th@@ ey're not just sitting there.
It takes the base metal of our conven@@ tional wisdom and trans@@ forms it through ridicul@@ e into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world.
My kids deserve so much better.
There has to be a way to take a cen@@ sus of the rest of the bacteria in the population.
So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to coo@@ k@@ ; boys ar@@ en@@ '@@ t.
"@@ But -- and I hope you are expec@@ ting a ""@@ but@@ "" by now -- but that wasn't true for every@@ one."

"U@@ sing Google Earth you can witness tra@@ w@@ l@@ ers -- in China, the North Se@@ a, the G@@ ul@@ f of Mex@@ ico -- sha@@ king the foundation of our life support system, leaving plu@@ mes of death in their path@@ ."
"@@ (Laughter) So, we turned to the data again."
"@@ Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting respon@@ se."
So something to think about ton@@ ight if you've had a coup@@ le.
"@@ Wh@@ o am I being, that my children's eyes are not shin@@ ing?"
"@@ They thought it would be difficult to make it as an artist@@ , that it will be a challen@@ ge."
There isn't an education system on the planet that teach@@ es dance every day to children the way we teach them mathema@@ tics.
"@@ And that is, there is a sudden emergen@@ ce and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use, the use of fi@@ re, the use of shel@@ ters, and, of course, language, and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpre@@ t that person's behavior."
So I'd like to show you the top four priori@@ ties which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
The rest of the her@@ d turned and began to follow@@ .
"@@ I gave it to another 100 stud@@ ents. H@@ ere is what happen@@ ed@@ : Now the most popular option became the least popul@@ ar, and the least popular became the most popul@@ ar."

"@@ Ye@@ t, despite all the advan@@ ces in medical technology, the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still rema@@ ined so limi@@ ted."
"@@ And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience, from working with dying people and training care@@ gi@@ ver@@ s, that any att@@ ach@@ ment to out@@ come would distor@@ t deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrop@@ he@@ ."

BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Fin@@ ance Minis@@ ter of Gre@@ ece earlier this year.
"@@ The brain scan@@ s showed activ@@ ation in a part of the brain called the insul@@ a, a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compas@@ sion."
"@@ Be@@ at, be@@ at, be@@ at, be@@ at, be@@ at."

I'm fascinated by how people got to be there.
"@@ It's used to treat oste@@ opor@@ os@@ is, and they got that twice a year."
23 percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving bir@@ th.
These are hospit@@ alized patient@@ s.
And here's the front door of this facilit@@ y.
And let's start simple -- let's start with one listen@@ er and one brain are@@ a: the audit@@ ory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear@@ .
"@@ (Laughter) I thought to myself, ""What now@@ ? W@@ here do I tur@@ n@@ ?"""
"@@ I'm a convic@@ t; I am bran@@ ded '@@ wrong@@ .@@ ' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong@@ ?"""
"T@@ wo breast cancer organiz@@ ations, Bre@@ ast Cancer A@@ ction and FO@@ R@@ CE@@ , had organized a demonstra@@ tion on the cour@@ thou@@ se ste@@ ps."
"I@@ n S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land, back about 15 years ago, they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste du@@ mp@@ s."

"@@ We're now on the cou@@ ch, looking out through the window at cars passing b@@ y."
"E@@ qu@@ ine veterinari@@ ans also know that occasion@@ ally, a mar@@ e, soon after giving bir@@ th, will neg@@ lec@@ t the fo@@ al, ref@@ using to nur@@ se, and in some inst@@ anc@@ es, kick the fo@@ al, even to death."
I cannot will myself to be passion@@ ate at 7@@ 1@@ .
"@@ So let's give it a try, let's rock and roll@@ , let's floo@@ d the world with climate activ@@ ist@@ s."
"@@ W@@ ith that, I would like to just say that Jack Lor@@ d said this almost 10 years ago."
They didn't know why they didn't kill me.
So she gives a gu@@ est lec@@ ture for me when I teach@@ .
"@@ The first one is, we've targeted the in@@ tras@@ pe@@ ci@@ es communication system."
L@@ et us stop telling people and our children there's only one way to go@@ ver@@ n ourselves and a sing@@ ular future towards which all societies must evol@@ ve.
The data shows this very clear@@ ly.
This is C@@ S 10@@ 1@@ .
This is the commun@@ it@@ y's normal@@ .
And you can find them on Google Ear@@ th.
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patient@@ s.
"@@ What if being obese is just a metab@@ oli@@ c response to something much more threaten@@ ing, an underlying epidemic@@ , the one we ought to be worried about@@ ?"
(Laughter) Not a problem.
So that's more than 100 trillion mil@@ es.
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always we@@ as@@ el your way out of them.
"I@@ n my lab, we recently found that people with min@@ or facial anom@@ ali@@ es and dis@@ figu@@ re@@ ments are regar@@ ded as less good, less kin@@ d, less intellig@@ ent, less compet@@ ent and less hard@@ work@@ ing."
The dou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut ma@@ ker took me so seri@@ ous@@ ly.

"@@ They are simple sum@@ mari@@ es of what's going on inside your body, kind of like a bar@@ ome@@ ter."

"@@ We created a website that actually does this and we launched it [@@ ...@@ ] in Augus@@ t, on two college camp@@ us@@ es."
"@@ And of course, who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these."
I make que@@ er media for kids because I wish I had this when I was their age.
The number should be one.
Th@@ ou@@ sands of these new arri@@ val@@ s have experienced incredible trau@@ ma.
They claim that they are batt@@ ling a das@@ tar@@ dly cons@@ pir@@ acy.
I am a very visual think@@ er.

"A@@ fter many iter@@ ations working with exper@@ ts, medical health profession@@ als and the women themselves, I should say it was not an easy process at all, but we had a simple and beautiful desig@@ n."
So this is a piece which goes from away to home.
"@@ When I talk to my patients, my pal@@ li@@ ative care patients, many of whom are facing illnes@@ ses that will end their lives, they have a lot of be frighten@@ ed of -- pain, n@@ au@@ sea, v@@ om@@ it@@ ing, con@@ sti@@ pa@@ tion, fa@@ ti@@ gue, their im@@ pen@@ ding mortal@@ ity."

"B@@ ut, you know, we have become obsessed with this lin@@ ear narra@@ tive."
"@@ We could actually take these 99 different vir@@ uses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three gen@@ omes that had been previ@@ ously published from Guine@@ a, we could show that the outbreak emer@@ ged in Guine@@ a months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmit@@ ting from human to human@@ ."

"I@@ n between all the other frequ@@ encies form a continu@@ ous band of color, called the visible spectr@@ um."

"@@ And while I've tried to make my images not too graph@@ ic, keep in mind that surge@@ ons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do, because, after all, what a surge@@ on does to a patient, if it were done without cons@@ ent, would be a fel@@ on@@ y."

"@@ That is, combin@@ ing two or more fiel@@ ds and creating something new at the intersec@@ tion."

"@@ (Laughter) And it wasn't until I got to the air@@ por@@ t chec@@ k-@@ in coun@@ ter, that I realized I didn't have my pas@@ spor@@ t."

Don't under@@ estimate the power of words.
M@@ aybe that's because you don't actually have ac@@ ne@@ .
"B@@ ased on epidemi@@ ological data, we know that one of the caus@@ es, or one of the associ@@ ations, I should say, is advanced pat@@ er@@ nal age, that is, increasing age of the father at the time of concep@@ tion."

"@@ When we did that, we saw that both of these fli@@ ck@@ ering rates appear@@ ed in their brain signals, but interest@@ ingly, only one of them, which was paid attention to, had stronger signals, so there was something in the brain which was hand@@ ling this information so that thing in the brain was basically the activ@@ ation of the frontal are@@ a."
"@@ It's this in@@ justice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness, and a particularly critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gul@@ f between the knowledge we have that can transform lives, the knowledge of effective treat@@ ments, and how we actually use that knowledge in the everyday world."
S@@ ome people have even suggested we should s@@ nor@@ t oxyto@@ cin@@ ...
You can also ri@@ g your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish@@ .

"@@ I think most of you do, but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism."

"@@ And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescent@@ s, have to go through two adolescen@@ ces."

"@@ And for me, that seven years was like total blis@@ s, because I was read@@ ing, I was writ@@ ing, I was thinking, I was research@@ ing."
"@@ (Laughter) I have always loved math and science, later, co@@ ding."

"F@@ or example, doctors have noticed an up@@ tic@@ k of something called Gu@@ ill@@ ain@@ -@@ Bar@@ r@@ é syn@@ drome in recent out@@ brea@@ ks."
"@@ So my whole picture of the animal king@@ dom, and including humans also, started to change at that time."
So I was bu@@ m@@ me@@ d.
L@@ et me show you.

"@@ I was a sur@@ fer@@ , a social science stud@@ ent, a friend to good people, a loved brother and son, an out@@ door re@@ creation gu@@ ide, and event@@ u@@ ally, a you@@ th work@@ er."

"Re@@ member@@ , when you're under stress, the brain releas@@ es corti@@ sol@@ ."

Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listen@@ ers in the same brain are@@ a.
"L@@ y@@ mp@@ ha@@ tic vessels, which serve as path@@ ways for immune cells, have recently been discovered in the brain, and they may also play a role in clear@@ ing out the brain's daily waste produc@@ ts."

"@@ And I was worried that if I looked too femin@@ ine, I would not be taken seri@@ ously."
"O@@ ur retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so we call that range of light visible light."

"As for me, I had always thought myself t@@ ough@@ , one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentra@@ tion camp@@ ."
So I was the first subjec@@ t.
"@@ We're hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy ses@@ sion with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten, so you keep coming back."
"@@ And she read so many nov@@ el@@ s, so many different nov@@ els here."
"I@@ f we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sic@@ k-@@ care system, why don't we just do it?"
"@@ But of course, mental illnes@@ ses can kill in more direct ways as well. The most obvious example is suici@@ de."
"@@ And when the doctor begins the vis@@ it, she knows heigh@@ t, weigh@@ t, is there food at home, is the family living in a shel@@ ter."

"A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms to affect lif@@ esp@@ an, and here it affects lif@@ esp@@ an in people."

There is no incentive to improve the quality of your produc@@ t.
The most interesting part to me is the last if state@@ ment.
"@@ There are many, many things we can do out there, but we've not had the pr@@ ic@@ es, nor the siz@@ es."
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So you might be thinking there's a dan@@ ger in this.
My estima@@ tion is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passion@@ ate about classical music.
"@@ W@@ as it perhaps the coming of modern@@ ity, with its celebra@@ tion of rest@@ less@@ ness and travel and progress that made sic@@ ken@@ ing for the familiar seem rather un@@ ambi@@ ti@@ ous@@ ?"
"@@ 9@@ 7 percent of the land in the Gal@@ apag@@ os Is@@ lands is protec@@ ted, but the ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent sea is being ra@@ v@@ aged by fis@@ h@@ ing."
"@@ And then, when I got home, I thought, ""@@ That was so terrible and so great@@ ."
But everybody was happy to see me.
It is easier than you thin@@ k.
(Laughter) It was the sad@@ dest and long@@ est night of his life as well.
I love that.
"@@ And by the way, why do these hotel@@ s focus on the os@@ ten@@ si@@ ble supply rather than the demand for sex work@@ er@@ s?"
And the only answer I can give you is: not everything is as easy as it soun@@ ds.
Th@@ en we broke it back down to see which elements make up that under@@ water loo@@ k.
But it's really more like this: let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30@@ s -- and you're a bac@@ hel@@ or and you're d@@ ating people.
So something went wrong with us at the top of that animal king@@ dom as women.
And so I wanted to create an image of a sil@@ ent catastrop@@ he@@ .
"T@@ o see -- wait a minute, we can go k@@ sh@@ h@@ plas@@ h! -- right there, ha -- under the oce@@ an, see what the whal@@ es see."

L@@ T: I don't know if it's essenti@@ al.
"Con@@ sid@@ er, for example, a condition like epile@@ ps@@ y, where the brain is over@@ activ@@ e."

"N@@ ick Par@@ lan@@ te: F@@ or each p@@ ix@@ el in the image, set the red to zer@@ o."
"@@ But you care about ner@@ ves, if you are a surgical patient@@ ."
So it doesn't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death senten@@ ce.
(Laughter) What about fear@@ ?
"@@ Th@@ rough@@ out European history, we find them in the work of the al@@ chem@@ ists, and of course we still believe this today, only we tell this story using the vocabul@@ ary of science."

How are these constru@@ als reflec@@ ted in languag@@ e?
"@@ And if that seems like a little thing for somebody with chronic illness, it's not -- not at all."
"I@@ n high school, my G@@ P@@ A was .@@ 6@@ 5."
This is a little trick that you're taught to use as kids.

"@@ We love challeng@@ es, but when expecta@@ tions are lo@@ w, trust me, we will sin@@ k to them."

"@@ Now, the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pin@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ gray f@@ les@@ h, amor@@ ph@@ ous."
We're going to ask another question.
"C@@ r@@ y@@ ing, frighten@@ ed, unable to understand what's happening to him, he was right on the ver@@ ge of developing a new trau@@ ma@@ ."
"@@ He was like, ""No one has done this befor@@ e."""
And you're playing a painful soun@@ d.
"R@@ ight now, we just don't have that many protec@@ tions."
Is there really nothing good or bad@@ ?
"J@@ ust remember that, when we think about what we're doing."
"@@ And we create these path@@ ways, this cognitive reser@@ ve, by learning new things."

"@@ You can deci@@ de, what is your mental state@@ : OK, I choose the caf@@ fe@@ in@@ ated te@@ a, I choose the cham@@ om@@ ile te@@ a."

"@@ And it all happened in a single place, Ti@@ er 1@@ -@@ A, on the night shif@@ t."

"O@@ ri@@ gin@@ als are non@@ conform@@ ists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to cham@@ pi@@ on them."
So that's not good. Stu@@ f@@ f could be hidden in there.

But that wasn't the only reason I passed on War@@ by Park@@ er.
"I@@ n that case, I would answer with my social identi@@ ty, and check the box for ""@@ bl@@ ack@@ ."""
That's essentially a guar@@ ante@@ e of what the LH@@ C will fin@@ d.
"S@@ ome@@ one on st@@ af@@ f called 9@@ 1@@ 1, someone else es@@ cor@@ ted the kids and teens down@@ stair@@ s, somebody went to fla@@ g down the ambul@@ ance in the par@@ k."

(Laughter) That seems like a one-@@ question I@@ Q test.
"@@ So he k@@ ic@@ ks off what could be with, ""This is a day I've been looking forward to for two and a half year@@ s."""
And the first mur@@ der of a mother by a son was my great-great-@@ great-great-@@ great-great-@@ grand@@ father@@ .
"L@@ uck@@ ily, however, we struck the educational j@@ ack@@ po@@ t in a volun@@ tar@@ y des@@ e@@ gre@@ gation program that bu@@ ses in@@ ner@@ -@@ city kids -- black and brown -- out to sub@@ urban schools -- rich and whi@@ te."
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
That is what econom@@ ists do.
But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expen@@ si@@ ve@@ ?
"@@ Now, I started with a quo@@ te from Sam@@ u@@ el John@@ son, who said that when we make choice in life, we shouldn't forget to li@@ ve."
"@@ Now, I've talked about the patient as if the patient is, some@@ how, someone abstract outside this room."
T@@ o hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right makes the employees feel great.

"O@@ ne of them you heard about@@ : dark matter, dark energy."
O@@ kay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible.
So what do the experts sa@@ y?
"@@ This is the beginning of the book I wro@@ te, '@@ An@@ gr@@ y Wh@@ ite M@@ en@@ .@@ ' These were four angr@@ y white men who believed that the@@ y, white men in America, were the victims of reverse discrimin@@ ation in the work@@ place."
It's a my@@ ster@@ y.
"U@@ sing the second head, which is a cam@@ era, we mean@@ der to the site of infec@@ tion."

"@@ The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at, who was a mur@@ der@@ er, and was a seri@@ al kill@@ er, had damage to their orb@@ ital cortex, which is right above the eyes, the orbit@@ s, and also the interior part of the temporal lo@@ be."
"@@ What's interesting to me is, these are called ""@@ alternative educa@@ tion."""
So I'm going to say awes@@ ome stuff about my@@ self.
"@@ And I say, ""Oh no, in fact, what you have to start calcul@@ ating is how much gender ine@@ quality is already cost@@ ing you."
W@@ ould you all like to stand up for a moment@@ ?
I fell in love with that guy.
So I'll read it to you.
"@@ But what did dist@@ ur@@ b her was she got very persist@@ ent images or hallucinations of fac@@ es, and as with Ros@@ ali@@ e, the faces were often de@@ for@@ med, with very large tee@@ th or very large eyes."
"S@@ ince we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simp@@ ler way."

Dis@@ crimin@@ ation and racis@@ m also matters in other profound ways for health.
What is a scientist with no labor@@ ator@@ y?

"I@@ f I've met you before, I don't remember@@ ."""
"@@ (Laughter) And that, by the way, is why I think men so often wear ties."
"@@ Is@@ n't it just a lot of fun@@ ?"""
And let me tell you why I have that perspec@@ tive.
We have the capacity to lau@@ gh and cr@@ y.
"@@ Th@@ ose of you who have seen the film ""@@ Mon@@ ey@@ ball@@ ,"" or have read the book by Michael Le@@ w@@ is, will be familiar with the story of B@@ illy Be@@ an@@ e."

"@@ But the home needs to start passing on coo@@ king again, for su@@ re."

That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.
"@@ When the planets were first form@@ ing, they were orb@@ iting within a dis@@ c of gas, and while inside that dis@@ c@@ , they can actually slide around and ad@@ just their or@@ bits to their neighbor@@ s until they're perfectly in tun@@ e."
So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human@@ .
"S@@ o, that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job@@ ."

Let's focus on people first.
This is what we really need if we're going to build systems on top of computer visi@@ on.
"@@ And finally, once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their di@@ et, how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the defaul@@ t rather than the excep@@ tion?"
"F@@ or those of you old enough to remember, we used to have to go to the store to ste@@ al it."
This leave should be state@@ -@@ subsi@@ diz@@ ed.
"A@@ fter all, any child born today will have to live in a world where h@@ urr@@ ican@@ es, floo@@ ding, wil@@ d@@ fires -- what we used to call natural disas@@ ters -- have become common@@ place."
"@@ So we're going along with this. And here@@ 's, just to give you the patter@@ n."
"@@ I'm going to ask you to participa@@ te, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you color@@ ed words. I want you to sh@@ out out the color of the in@@ k."
"@@ There's the pun@@ k on the ground, p@@ ud@@ dle of bloo@@ d."
"@@ And that's my ho@@ pe, too."
I love them. They all have one idea and one really clear visual that conve@@ ys the idea.
"@@ What these pictures demonstr@@ ate is that there is a moral sense across all religi@@ ons, across all fai@@ th@@ s, across all contin@@ ents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others, and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a du@@ ty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righ@@ ted, see injur@@ ies that need to be correc@@ ted, see problems that need to be rec@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed."
So what he did is he actually reached inside of the hear@@ ts of the audi@@ ence.
And you can see there they're shopping with their hel@@ me@@ ts.
"@@ And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brain@@ s."
"@@ W@@ e've had the U.@@ N@@ . for almost 60 years, yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world, and said, which of them should we do first@@ ?"
"@@ How is DNA isol@@ ated, and why isn't that an inven@@ tion?"
(Laughter) (Applause) Don't you feel@@ ?
And this is how to star@@ t: we must raise our daughter@@ s different@@ ly.
He was 7@@ 8 years old.
"@@ So here's an examp@@ le: One recent study took two groups of agnos@@ tics, that is people who are un@@ decided in their religious beli@@ ef@@ s."
"S@@ o, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formul@@ a for life and good health."
I am also autis@@ tic.
I believe that at the cru@@ x of all of this is a single piece of paper@@ : the ré@@ su@@ mé@@ .
"@@ And they're breaking down, and there's going to be ever more of them, and we haven't even seen the start of the consequences of that."
But some people experience cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing anxiety before a test.
"@@ I am talking about thre@@ ats that are so severe or per@@ vas@@ ive that they literally get under our skin and change our physi@@ olog@@ y: things like ab@@ use or neg@@ lec@@ t, or growing up with a par@@ ent who strugg@@ les with mental illness or substance dependen@@ ce."
"@@ That's a huge responsibil@@ ity, a huge bur@@ den on every@@ one's shoul@@ ders, y@@ es."
It is said today that bio@@ tech is advan@@ cing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of compu@@ ters.
"@@ I want to live on in my apart@@ ment@@ ."""
"@@ So we are continu@@ ously giving training to men, and I really believe strong@@ ly."
"@@ And so the up@@ side here, and the subject for a different TED Tal@@ k on a different day, is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combin@@ ation that will provide us new treat@@ ments, new insigh@@ ts into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better@@ ?"
"@@ When I was an entrepren@@ eur@@ , I was presented with an investment opportun@@ ity, and then I was turned down."
"@@ And I just said, ""No@@ ? I'm sorr@@ y."""
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society.
"@@ But eventually this sense of bore@@ dom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging any@@ more -- it would get to be too much."
We thought that the physical states of their body might change how they percei@@ ved the dist@@ ance.
"I@@ t took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon foot@@ print nearly in half@@ ."
A@@ gr@@ icul@@ tural p@@ est@@ s. Mal@@ aria par@@ as@@ it@@ es.
"Un@@ like any pop culture phenomenon before it, video games actually allow us to become part of the machine."
So I've gone from memory pione@@ er to exercise explor@@ er.
"@@ That way, you create acces@@ s."
"@@ But this was s@@ pot@@ ted by an e@@ ag@@ le-@@ eye investig@@ ator, and he was convic@@ ted."
"L@@ ar@@ ge amounts of data, expert physicians and expert medical imaging technologi@@ es."
I was quite proud of that one.
"@@ Th@@ ey're all the perfect size, and they don't have an oun@@ ce of fat@@ ."
"O@@ n the vertical ax@@ is, you'll see the percentage of babies who squee@@ zed the ball in each condition, and as you'll see, babies are much more likely to gener@@ alize the evidence when it's plausi@@ bly represent@@ ative of the population than when the evidence is clearly ch@@ err@@ y-@@ pic@@ ked."
That makes 12 of them.
"@@ '@@ We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent, that all men are created equ@@ al@@ .@@ '@@ "" So he uses the little orange text there to remind them of the promise that the politici@@ ans had made to him or that this country had ma@@ de."
It depends sole@@ ly on whether you feel emotionally or soci@@ ally dis@@ connected from those around you.
"@@ and the top result was ""@@ demon@@ s."""
"@@ But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritu@@ ally connec@@ ted, because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contem@@ pla@@ tion at its hear@@ t."
I went in to see her.
So I think half of my book adv@@ ance went into sun@@ scre@@ en.
"@@ Not because you're culp@@ able for your emo@@ tions, but because the actions and the experiences that you make today become your brain's predic@@ tions for tomor@@ ro@@ w."
"@@ That was the experience of my patient, Ch@@ and@@ ler, whom you see in the photograph@@ ."
It has lower tax@@ es.
"@@ Be@@ fore he arrived R@@ onal@@ d Re@@ agan said -- and he was the Swe@@ dis@@ h S@@ ocial D@@ emo@@ cra@@ tic Pr@@ ime Minis@@ ter -- ""@@ Is@@ n@@ ’t this man a commun@@ ist@@ ?"""
"@@ And carto@@ ons can cross boun@@ d@@ ari@@ es, as you have se@@ en."
"To@@ o much of it results in the loss of synap@@ tic connections between neurons and the shr@@ in@@ king of your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain the regul@@ ates behaviors like concentra@@ tion, decision-ma@@ king, judg@@ em@@ ent, and social interac@@ tion."
"A@@ t the time, I thought this was all pretty miser@@ able."
And the truth is that no one really car@@ es what you say when you're that age.
F@@ or this hundre@@ d@@ -year-old fis@@ her@@ man it was continu@@ ing to catch fish for his family three times a wee@@ k.
We found some non@@ toxic refriger@@ ants that worked at very low va@@ por pres@@ sur@@ es.
You will no longer go to a breast cancer clin@@ ic.
"@@ (Applause) We protected bi@@ kers by flo@@ ating par@@ king lan@@ es, and it's been great@@ ."

"@@ Because in this game of hide and see@@ k, every time you don't find added su@@ gar, you win@@ !"
"@@ And there it was, the seat of human consciousness, the power@@ house of the human body, sitting in my hand@@ s."
"In@@ jur@@ ies to all us@@ ers, pe@@ des@@ tri@@ ans, cy@@ cl@@ ists, driver@@ s, are all down 50 percent."
"@@ We're smar@@ ter, we're more flexi@@ ble, we can learn more, we survive in more different environ@@ ments, we migra@@ ted to cover the world and even go to outer space."
So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do.
"F@@ or men, we've had the same two op@@ tions for more than a hundred year@@ s: con@@ do@@ ms and vas@@ ec@@ tom@@ y."
"@@ And there was a little study about people who don't handsha@@ ke, and compar@@ ing them with ones who do handsha@@ ke."
There was also a 6@@ 5@@ -year-old man who participa@@ ted.
And those P@@ os@@ t-@@ it no@@ tes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bro@@ mo@@ do@@ main@@ s.
How shall I best organize society when the need for human labor dimin@@ ish@@ es?
"C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ m@@ 's doing it by replac@@ ing low-@@ w@@ age workers with auto@@ mat@@ a, and@@ ro@@ id@@ s, ro@@ bot@@ s."
"@@ And she told me -- the nurses had@@ n't mentioned this -- that she was blin@@ d, that she had been completely blind from mac@@ ular de@@ generation for five years."
"@@ (Laughter) But I knew that Americans get ir@@ ony when I came across that legis@@ la@@ tion, ""No Chil@@ d L@@ ef@@ t Be@@ hin@@ d."""
But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV@@ ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscien@@ ce.

And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spi@@ ke.
Health to the ocean means health for us.
And we are good at training our warri@@ ors to figh@@ t.
"@@ You could stick it on the front of a T-@@ shir@@ t, which is always the sign of ele@@ gan@@ ce."
"@@ And in the winter there, it gets very cold and very ic@@ y."
"Ten years ago, computer vision researchers thought that getting a computer to tell the difference between a ca@@ t and a dog would be almost im@@ possible, even with the significant adv@@ ance in the state of artificial intelligen@@ ce."
"O@@ f course, they must be more energy effici@@ ent."
"I@@ n combin@@ atori@@ c ter@@ ms, this problem would be phras@@ ed as tw@@ el@@ ve choose five, and could be calcul@@ ated with this formul@@ a, or you could just look at the six@@ th ele@@ ment of row tw@@ el@@ ve on the triang@@ le and get your answer."
So here's a tradi@@ tionally color@@ ed under@@ water scen@@ e.
"@@ So let your hat@@ ers ha@@ te, you know what, and make your change, because I know you can@@ ."
And so on.
But traditional incu@@ bat@@ ors require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollar@@ s.
I am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to ey@@ e.
How would that change the cap@@ abili@@ ties of the surge@@ on?
"@@ And it very slow@@ ly, over a few minutes, sort of pain@@ fully goes up, and then it ga@@ ins moment@@ um and it looks like it's almost about to fall@@ ."
"@@ I think it's fair to say -- (Applause) -- it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bi@@ ke, and now New York has become one of the cy@@ cl@@ ing capit@@ als in the United States."
"@@ The World Fo@@ od Pro@@ gram@@ me was for@@ ce@@ d, for lack of resources, to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syri@@ an refuge@@ es."

"@@ Th@@ ey, the wo@@ od@@ pec@@ k@@ ers, typically will pec@@ k, they will ban@@ g their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day. E@@ very day@@ !"
Per@@ haps you have a computer scientist who's a geni@@ us.
"F@@ irst, there's a level of fin@@ e-@@ gra@@ ined conceptu@@ al structure, which we automatically and un@@ consciously compu@@ te every time we produce or ut@@ ter a senten@@ ce, that go@@ ver@@ ns our use of language."

"@@ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intens@@ ity, the first step for me is to be patient, to listen to what's going on and pull from something that's going on around me."
Sch@@ ol@@ ars have long inv@@ o@@ ked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temp@@ ta@@ tion.
"@@ There are ang@@ els around America doing great things in schools -- far@@ m@@ -to-@@ school se@@ t-@@ up@@ s, gar@@ den se@@ t-@@ up@@ s, education -- there are amazing people doing this al@@ read@@ y."
"@@ But the wel@@ f@@ are workers and the ambul@@ ance people and the judge all said the same thing: ""We hate to do it but we have to follow proce@@ du@@ re@@ ."""
And the reason is that you take it for gran@@ ted.
"S@@ he felt cruci@@ fied by her experience, but she didn't want to let that cruci@@ fied self die."
And that's what she does.
"@@ I once visi@@ ted a day care cent@@ er, where I saw three tod@@ d@@ l@@ ers play with identical plastic to@@ y@@ s."
"@@ How do I get this remo@@ ve@@ d@@ ?"""
C@@ an you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psycholog@@ ically healthi@@ er@@ ?
"In@@ spi@@ red by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solu@@ tion, something that could work without electri@@ city, that was simple enough for a mother or a mid@@ wife to use, given that the majority of bir@@ ths still take place in the home."
"@@ The data from that then can be used to understand the geo@@ graphic and genetic divers@@ ity, which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immun@@ olog@@ ically, and what type of reactions they promo@@ te."
S@@ ome people were just plain ru@@ de.
"@@ And finally, American families also pay a price for oil@@ ."

"@@ So it ta@@ k@@ es, al@@ read@@ y, a long time to selec@@ t the patients, do the treatment and evalu@@ ate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment."
"A teacher told me, ""I returned to work eight weeks after my son was bor@@ n."
"@@ Now, what that tells us is that our traditional vocabul@@ aries for discus@@ sing these issues are totally obsole@@ te."

"@@ What's fascinating is that despite its pro@@ ven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works."

"@@ And of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decision@@ s, well, that's sure to gra@@ b people's attention."
"@@ So the great project of our gener@@ ation, it seems to me, is to build for the first time, out of a global eth@@ ic and our global ability to communicate and organize together, a truly global society, built on that eth@@ ic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future."

That tells us several things.
And then people ca@@ me.
"@@ So the next time you st@@ are at a perio@@ dic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a fi@@ ve-@@ dollar coffee mu@@ g, D@@ mit@@ ri Mende@@ le@@ ev@@ , the architec@@ t of the perio@@ dic table, will be star@@ ing back."

So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand@@ .
"@@ And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Ge@@ ely, they acquired the Vol@@ vo company, and then finally the Swe@@ des understood that something big had happened in the world."
We really don't give them the chan@@ ce.
"@@ The goal is to protect bio@@ divers@@ ity, to provide st@@ ability and resili@@ ence."
"F@@ or example, research shows that asking someone about suicid@@ al thoughts actually redu@@ ces their suicide ris@@ k."
"@@ Because that's what turns an artistic statement really, into a creative di@@ alo@@ gu@@ e."

"@@ We even have some pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary evid@@ ences that these micro@@ organis@@ ms may still be active in the des@@ ic@@ ca@@ ted state, like walking mu@@ m@@ mi@@ es all around us, and that they may be using U@@ V radi@@ ation as a source of energy."
"@@ But our question really was, do our non@@ verb@@ als go@@ ver@@ n how we think and feel about oursel@@ ves@@ ?"
This was one of those scen@@ es.
And he said that he had so much money st@@ as@@ hed in his up@@ per@@ -@@ East side apart@@ ment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depres@@ sion.
"C@@ an we, as adults, grow new nerve cell@@ s?"
H@@ ere's a study published by a team of researchers as an op@@ -@@ ed in The New York Tim@@ es.
And we have to bring an example from across the pon@@ d.
I started when I was 15 years old.
"S@@ te@@ p back, give your mother a brea@@ k, oka@@ y."
It was frighten@@ ing news because I had no experience with chronic illness or dis@@ abili@@ ties.
"@@ And he was working very hard on this present@@ ation -- graph@@ s, tab@@ les, information."
They saw everything.
"@@ So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquit@@ os@@ ?"
So let me tell you a little bit about what rating ag@@ encies really do.
"@@ You might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules or, to my tas@@ te, new drugs for cancer."
"@@ Th@@ en he moves back and forth between ""I have a dream that one day, I have a dream that one day, I have a dream that one day@@ ,"" and at the end, it gets really interest@@ ing."
They are the things the victims of gen@@ oci@@ de in Bos@@ ni@@ a carried with them on their final journe@@ y.
S@@ ome@@ thing has happened to my brain.
G@@ et smarter incentiv@@ es.
How could we care about something less than about something that happens after we di@@ e?
Mor@@ al ambigu@@ ity starts to clim@@ b@@ .
"O@@ ne experimenter expressed a negative value towards pres@@ sing the remo@@ te, saying, ""Y@@ u@@ ck, the toy mo@@ ve@@ d@@ ,"" while the other experimenter expressed a positive valu@@ e, saying, ""Y@@ a@@ y, the toy mo@@ ve@@ d."""
And this isn't a sta@@ tic number@@ .
"@@ And the re@@ efs disappe@@ are@@ d, and new is@@ lands for@@ med, and we thought, ""Well, we're real smar@@ t."
"@@ Th@@ eir groun@@ d@@ breaking technology records the EE@@ G, or the electrical activity of the brain, in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it per@@ forms various functions and then detect even the sligh@@ test ab@@ normal@@ ity in any of these func@@ tion@@ s: vision, attention, language, audi@@ tion."
"B@@ illi@@ ons of dollars are spent every year, all over the glo@@ be, on these char@@ lat@@ an@@ s."
"I@@ n fact, I did not know what African auth@@ enti@@ city was."
It has taken me years to try to accept my son@@ 's leg@@ acy.
"O@@ n be@@ half of H@@ al and myself, I wish all the best to your present and future sel@@ ves."
What it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your microbial eco@@ logy than hundreds of miles on Ear@@ th.
"@@ And of course, the object had to be very gr@@ and and have a sense of ritu@@ al@@ ism, the way my uncle likes it."
"""@@ I wish A@@ sh@@ ley Jud@@ d would die a horrible death."
F@@ ive times as many centen@@ ari@@ ans as we have in America@@ .
There's actually a lot of evidence in prima@@ tes and other animals that they return favor@@ s.
We all know this man.
"I@@ f we don't get that right, I'm not sure all the climate solutions in the world will save man@@ kin@@ d, because so much depends on how we shape our ci@@ ti@@ es: not just environmental impac@@ ts, but our social well-@@ being, our economic vit@@ ality, our sense of community and connec@@ ted@@ ness."
"@@ And I han@@ ded out these post@@ car@@ ds randomly on the streets of Washington, D.@@ C@@ ., not knowing what to expec@@ t."

8@@ 8 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a bab@@ y.
And so let's fly back in time to that memor@@ able moment.
"@@ So starting from a three-@@ dimensional ping sound system, a vibr@@ ating v@@ est, a click whe@@ el with voice comman@@ ds, a le@@ g stri@@ p, even a sho@@ e that app@@ lies pressure to the foo@@ t."

(Laughter) It's not great for parents with kids.
"@@ They were more social, more ener@@ ge@@ tic."
That's where children experience life.
A@@ tar will then ask you some basic questions to understand your unique circumst@@ ances and determine your eli@@ gi@@ bility for resour@@ ces.
So this came back to me a little while lat@@ er.
"@@ And it starts with a problem of conf@@ oun@@ ded evidence that all of us have, which is that we are part of the world."
"@@ I said, ""I'm gon@@ na copy this."""
"@@ This er@@ a's mo@@ m, B@@ ree Van de K@@ amp@@ ."
"Se@@ an G@@ our@@ le@@ y: Ex@@ ac@@ tly. So we took 2@@ 4,000 TED@@ x Tal@@ ks from around the world, 14@@ 7 different countries, and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structu@@ res that under@@ ly the ideas behind them."
And the first mate takes a ro@@ pe and ties O@@ dys@@ seus to the m@@ ast in a nice kno@@ t.

"@@ (Laughter) I've been a little dis@@ ing@@ en@@ u@@ ous, because I've expan@@ ded it out in all its gor@@ y detail@@ ."
"@@ And this is especially new and true for s@@ pati@@ al recogni@@ tion -- so like, how you navi@@ gate your way in the city."
"@@ And one of them said, ""O@@ K@@ ."

"@@ (Applause) You are right now in the beautiful, sun@@ ny capital city ..."
What are these ter@@ m@@ s?
Let's look at the first vide@@ o.
"[@@ O@@ n A@@ pri@@ l 3, 201@@ 6 we saw the largest data lea@@ k in histor@@ y@@ .] [@@ The Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s exposed rich and powerful people@@ ] [@@ hiding vast amounts of money in off@@ shore accoun@@ ts@@ .] [@@ What does this mean@@ ?] [@@ We called Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ it@@ ness to expla@@ in@@ .] This week, there have been a whole sle@@ w and de@@ lu@@ ge of stories coming out from the lea@@ k of 11 million docu@@ ments from a Pan@@ am@@ ani@@ an-@@ based law fir@@ m called Mos@@ s@@ ack F@@ on@@ se@@ ca@@ ."
"@@ Because you're commit@@ ting for your future self, and of course your future self can save 27 percent."
H@@ at@@ ers gon@@ na ha@@ te.
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love ex@@ trover@@ ts.
"@@ And when you're describing your science, be@@ ware of j@@ arg@@ on."
"@@ (Laughter) So this is where rejection happened and I could have run@@ , but I sta@@ ye@@ d."
And he's perfectly making his way between the tw@@ o.
"@@ I think, as I said, essentially terror@@ ism in Europe is today a home@@ grown movement in relation to the global situation that we are fac@@ ing, and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong, by wel@@ coming and integr@@ ating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world."
"I@@ t gets shor@@ ter, you lose piec@@ es, it gets inser@@ tions."
"@@ Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastin@@ ation."
"@@ I mean, we all had those when we were litt@@ le."
So what we've got here now is the global foot@@ print of all the TED@@ x Tal@@ ks over the last four years explo@@ ding out around the world from New York all the way down to little old New Z@@ eal@@ and in the cor@@ ner@@ .
We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.
"@@ We all start thinking of all our faul@@ ts and all our shor@@ t@@ com@@ ings, what we wish we were, what we wish we wer@@ en@@ '@@ t."
"@@ What else, after all, is there@@ ?"
So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employe@@ es.
These two guys shared a similar visi@@ on.
"""@@ Now that you mention it, it does seem a little sil@@ ki@@ er@@ !"""
I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continu@@ es to promote a false and toxic view of human@@ ity.
"@@ Now, with these same brain proces@@ ses, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habit@@ s."
"T@@ o bring this to a wide@@ r audience, I've been working with H@@ al and Al@@ li@@ an@@ z to create something we call the behavioral time machin@@ e, in which you not only get to see yourself in the future, but you get to see antici@@ pa@@ ted emotional reactions to different levels of retirement weal@@ th."
It's real@@ .
This is a normal cell@@ . This is a cancer cell@@ .
"@@ When I got a military schol@@ ar@@ ship two weeks later, they let me go."
Th@@ ink of amyloid plaques as a lit mat@@ ch.
Th@@ ey're important because they speak to parts of children's being which are otherwise un@@ touche@@ d.
"@@ We're traveling from west to eas@@ t, over part of the ocean that would look fe@@ atu@@ re@@ less on a bi@@ g@@ -@@ scale ma@@ p, but actually some of these mountain@@ s are as big as E@@ ver@@ est."
"S@@ ome@@ times a good person would find it, sometimes a bad person would find it."
"@@ Th@@ ey're like cells -- they come together, they di@@ vide@@ ."
And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.
A@@ nother kind of bio@@ molecule might get a red color@@ .
And he wants to take all of that into accoun@@ t.
"@@ What was more per@@ tin@@ ent, and continu@@ es to be so about ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian democr@@ acy, was the incl@@ usion of the working po@@ or, who not only acquired the right to free spee@@ ch, but more importantly, cruci@@ ally, they acquired the rights to political judg@@ ments that were af@@ for@@ ded equal weight in the decision-@@ making concer@@ ning matters of state@@ ."
We pay them to leave their water in stream@@ .
"I@@ n biolog@@ y, we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in gener@@ al, so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us@@ ?"
You guys are not laugh@@ ing enough. I'm totally seri@@ ous.
"@@ Because in the end, with this color and this ha@@ ir, I cannot be@@ long to some plac@@ es."
You have a role to play and a choice to ma@@ ke.
"In@@ tro@@ version is more about, how do you respond to stimul@@ ation, including social stimul@@ ation."
"@@ It's not like your heart cells and kid@@ ney cells get all mixed up every day, and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on, these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is and what their tasks should be."
So here's that map of the human micro@@ bio@@ me again.
Pre@@ dic@@ tions are basically the way your brain works.
"@@ Jan@@ ma, meaning ""@@ birth@@ ,"" contain@@ ed a bloo@@ d-@@ absor@@ bing sheet for the woman to give birth on, a surgical scal@@ pel, a cord cl@@ amp@@ , a bar of so@@ ap@@ , a pair of glo@@ ves and the first clo@@ th to wi@@ pe the baby cle@@ an."
We can now talk about cancer without wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing.
"@@ It's called S@@ TR@@ ON@@ G, which is ""S@@ ec@@ ure Tr@@ ans@@ por@@ tation R@@ edu@@ cing O@@ il Ne@@ eds Gr@@ ad@@ u@@ all@@ y,"" and the idea is instead of being helpl@@ es@@ s, we need to be more strong@@ ."
We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaul@@ ts just by sto@@ pping repeat perpe@@ trat@@ ors earlier on.
"@@ W@@ ith him and with Ros@@ ali@@ e, what seems to be going on -- and Ros@@ ali@@ e said, ""Wh@@ at's going on@@ ?"" -- and I said that as you lose vision, as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any in@@ pu@@ t, they become hyper@@ active and exci@@ table, and they start to fire spontane@@ ously."
No@@ thing is automa@@ tic.
He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it.
"@@ The foods that are produced are, more or less, cor@@ n, so@@ y and whe@@ at."
"@@ And the answer should be, ""@@ Nor@@ th-@@ nor@@ the@@ ast in the far dist@@ ance."
"@@ This means that two brains of the same size, like these two, with a respec@@ table 400 gram@@ s, should have similar numbers of neurons."
(Laughter) You have given birth to an abo@@ min@@ ation.
"I@@ t was invented in 18@@ 5@@ 8, by this guy F@@ er@@ din@@ and Car@@ r@@ é, but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools at the time."
This is not expen@@ si@@ ve.
"@@ There are 1,@@ 600 people, I beli@@ e@@ ve."
So wh@@ y?
"O@@ ne thing that this baby could be thinking about, that could be going on in his mind, is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other bab@@ y."
"@@ You can also say, ""B@@ if@@ f went from sick to well@@ ."""
"""@@ W@@ hy@@ ?"" is a question that parents ask me all the time."
It's not because I think I'm speci@@ al.
"O@@ kay, induced pl@@ uri@@ pot@@ ent stem cells."
"@@ So these are healthy wor@@ ms, and you can see they're moving around norm@@ ally."
"@@ They set the pr@@ ic@@ es, and I don't even know."
"@@ And to change it, you've got to know where the power is, in the system."
And if we can think about how we can help these other countries.
I began to believe that I would never recover either from the accid@@ ent or from the with@@ dra@@ wal@@ .
This is a full bot@@ tle of Cal@@ ms For@@ te.
So bacteria always control patho@@ gen@@ ici@@ ty with qu@@ or@@ um sens@@ ing.
"A@@ t the end, there will only be one mark@@ er left standing and it will determine our wealth in reti@@ re@@ ment."
"@@ So I'm here today because I believe that a basic knowledge of organic chemistry is valu@@ able, and I think that it can be made acces@@ si@@ ble to every@@ body, and I'd like to prove that to you today."
"@@ He was bringing peace to a divi@@ ded and violent South Africa, one man with an un@@ believ@@ able sense of his human@@ ity."
"@@ There's always something to be done, something to be refin@@ ed."
And so it seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individu@@ als.
They might have a pu@@ rely physical ca@@ use.
"@@ Now, of course, this does not mean that we should all stop collabor@@ ating -- and case in point, is Steve Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ a@@ k fam@@ ously coming together with Steve J@@ ob@@ s to start Apple Com@@ pu@@ ter -- but it does mean that solit@@ u@@ de matters and that for some people it is the air that they brea@@ the@@ ."
Th@@ en I remember@@ ed it could be a bunch of things.
"@@ There are corals made of different forms of cal@@ ci@@ um carbon@@ ate growing off the bas@@ al@@ t of this massive under@@ sea moun@@ ta@@ in, and the dark sort of stuff, those are fossi@@ liz@@ ed cor@@ als, and we're going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time."
"@@ (Laughter) And I looked at Gor@@ an, and I said to him, ""F@@ or@@ get that."""
"R@@ el@@ ative to the universe, it's just up the road@@ ."
But we can stop that.
"@@ And so folks like Am@@ i K@@ lin have developed methods to be able to take inf@@ ant@@ s, small babies, and be able to use bi@@ om@@ ar@@ k@@ ers, in this case eye contact and eye track@@ ing, to identify an infant at ris@@ k."
Y@@ es. I am an af@@ fir@@ ma@@ tive action bab@@ y.
The custo@@ mer paid ca@@ sh@@ .
"@@ And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocamp@@ us, then we block certain memory abili@@ ties."
You cannot doubt the existence of your own conscious@@ ness.
"T@@ rap@@ ped underne@@ ath the boreal forest and wet@@ lands of nor@@ thern Al@@ ber@@ ta are these vast reser@@ ves of this stic@@ k@@ y, tar@@ -like b@@ itu@@ men."
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development di@@ vision of the human speci@@ es.
"O@@ K, there's a lot of run@@ ny nos@@ es and stu@@ b@@ bed to@@ es, but no matter who walks through the door to the E@@ R, we order the same test@@ s, we prescribe the same medica@@ tion, without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients."
Now we can do it at a level greater than 99 percent accur@@ acy.
"P@@ leas@@ e, I be@@ g of you, even though my time has finishe@@ d, either Arab@@ ic, English, French or Chin@@ es@@ e."
"S@@ in@@ cere@@ ly in@@ deb@@ ted to you, Nar@@ vella Ber@@ thi@@ a."""
"(@@ C@@ row@@ d nois@@ es) So in a co@@ ck@@ tail party like this, if I say, ""D@@ a@@ vid@@ , Sar@@ a, pay atten@@ tion@@ "" -- some of you just sat up."
I@@ NCRA would make a difference to the current system by ad@@ ding another non@@ prof@@ it play@@ er to the mix@@ .
"@@ So we're actually le@@ ver@@ aging that work to develop games for patients with low vision, and to have an impact on re@@ training their brain to see better."
"A@@ fter many years of training, of disciplin@@ ing, of search and strugg@@ le, he comes back."
And what are non@@ verbal expres@@ sions of power and domin@@ ance@@ ?
"@@ And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data point@@ s, which are the mechan@@ ically ventila@@ ted air, they're not simply a sub@@ set of the green data point@@ s, which are the out@@ door air@@ ."
S@@ ome@@ times the perspective is the illusi@@ on.
"@@ This of@@ fen@@ ds a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back, either@@ ."
The green line is the number of bike lan@@ es.
And so light sh@@ one upon the Dar@@ k A@@ ges of Europe@@ .
Gen@@ der is not an easy conversation to have.
"J@@ os@@ ep@@ h Lis@@ ter was a@@ ep@@ sis@@ 's, or ster@@ ilit@@ y@@ 's, biggest advoca@@ te, to a very very skep@@ tical bunch of surge@@ on@@ s."
"S@@ o, Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a wouldn't like Pep@@ si to play ball unless the whole world knew that Pep@@ si wasn't playing b@@ all."
Th@@ en there's a consu@@ mer@@ 's need for ultra@@ conveni@@ ence.
And Augus@@ te De@@ ter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
"I@@ f that sto@@ ps, it all goes away."
"S@@ o, it's a fundamental problem."
And one of the things I really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together.
L@@ et us not keep them and ourselves in the dar@@ k.
"O@@ ri@@ gin@@ ally found defen@@ ding sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led bacteria and ar@@ cha@@ ea against inv@@ ading vir@@ uses, naturally occurr@@ ing CRISPR uses two main compon@@ ents."
There's so many of you.
"@@ So with the patient's cons@@ ent, the doctors asked him what happened when they electr@@ ically stimul@@ ated that part of his brain."
W@@ e've all been taught about active listening and eye contact -- an intense st@@ are and a compassion@@ ate loo@@ k.
"I@@ f we travel back in time 20,000 years ago, the ear@@ th looked very much different."
"@@ Well, the patent office had been issu@@ ing these patents for more than 20 years."
These gli@@ al cells become activ@@ ated.
"@@ (Laughter) And so, what do you know, that drug was appro@@ ved."
She wants to di@@ e.
Sam@@ u@@ el is 16@@ . He's t@@ all. He's very hand@@ some@@ .
"F@@ or the first time, we had a flu vaccine developed ahead of time for a new and potentially dangerous stra@@ in, and the US government or@@ dered a sto@@ ck@@ pi@@ le."
W@@ ould our individual b@@ ills go down@@ ?
J@@ ust because a P@@ .@@ C. is not running W@@ in@@ do@@ ws doesn't mean that it's bro@@ k@@ en.
"@@ I'm really gla@@ d to say -- recently, we've been in correspon@@ den@@ ce with R@@ y@@ an -- that this story had a happy end@@ ing."
"@@ I said, is there any val@@ id@@ ity to this whole ad@@ age that when you're making decision@@ s, it's best to take the driver's se@@ at, be in char@@ ge, be in control@@ ?"
"@@ And I tell you, we coul@@ d."
[@@ Chin@@ es@@ e@@ ] And every@@ body's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their head@@ s.
"@@ This one is able to use ocean mis@@ t as a source of water, and stri@@ k@@ ingly lives in the very bottom of a ca@@ ve, so it has adap@@ ted to live with less than 0@@ .@@ 1 percent of the amount of light that regular plan@@ ts nee@@ d."
So Scott gets this call@@ .
So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video gam@@ e.
I wanted to know how those children define concep@@ ts like par@@ en@@ tho@@ od and family.
"@@ They took the whole team away, even in match seas@@ on, on sk@@ i tri@@ ps and to look at social projects in Chica@@ go."
"@@ Now, that's not because there are no rich Americans who are st@@ as@@ hing their as@@ sets off@@ shor@@ e."
"I@@ f you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out."
"@@ And so once we've built the space, the question of the history of introspec@@ tion, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract and somehow v@@ agu@@ e, becomes concre@@ te -- becomes am@@ enable to quanti@@ ta@@ tive science."
So I call this emotional intelligence in ac@@ tion.
"S@@ cien@@ tists on Earth could then send the digital instructions to that DBC to make new medicin@@ es or to make synthetic organis@@ ms that produce oxy@@ gen, food, fuel or building materi@@ als, as a means for making the planet more habit@@ able for human@@ s."
So now this form of nur@@ sing has pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ated across the Ne@@ ther@@ lands and around the world.
"@@ I got to re@@ design my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liber@@ ation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snow@@ ball las@@ ting for a perfect moment, all the while mel@@ ting away."
"@@ He didn't actually buy anything, just some data."
"L@@ im@@ ited access to food, limited access to water, limited access to health care."
"@@ So the em@@ ber@@ s from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see, most of which turn out to have planets going around them."
"@@ (Laughter) So I hope you all can see, this is what objec@@ tivity looks like."
"@@ You know, one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the back@@ seat dri@@ ver, always telling the new one what to do."
I'm not sure I really even want it to.
And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through un@@ believ@@ able hu@@ mili@@ ation.
And those are lessons we really should learn@@ .
But this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population.
It's great to let go.
