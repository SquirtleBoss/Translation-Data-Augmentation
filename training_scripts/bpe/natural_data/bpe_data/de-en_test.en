"@@ It's known by some people in New H@@ av@@ en, obvi@@ ously, but it is not generally kno@@ wn."
"H@@ er def@@ aul@@ t position toward me, as an African@@ , was a kind of pat@@ ron@@ iz@@ ing, well-@@ meaning p@@ ity."

"@@ Rec@@ ently I took my family -- we do these rather kind of ner@@ dy mathematical tri@@ ps, which my family lo@@ ve."

"@@ I brought it to Paul Mac@@ C@@ read@@ y's company A@@ ero@@ Vir@@ on@@ ment to do a fe@@ asi@@ bility study, and they analy@@ zed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to pro@@ pel it."
"L@@ it@@ tle girl@@ : When I watch TV@@ , it's just some shows that you just -- that are pre@@ ten@@ d."

"@@ Now, here come two more people, and immediately af@@ ter, three more people."
"@@ The da@@ ir@@ y business in Keny@@ a is a $@@ 4@@ 6@@ 3 million business, and the difference between a sub@@ sist@@ ence far@@ mer and an abund@@ ance far@@ mer is only a couple of li@@ ters of mil@@ k a day."
"@@ The really sa@@ d thing is, in many parts of the world, we're raised to believe that strang@@ ers are dangerous by def@@ aul@@ t, that we can't trust them, that they might hurt us."
(Applause) I wrote this next po@@ em for my mo@@ ther.
(Applause) U@@ E@@ : Thank you very much.

"@@ This object was made by a hom@@ in@@ id ancest@@ or, Homo er@@ ec@@ tu@@ s or Homo erg@@ ast@@ er, between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language."
"@@ There's something I'm developing here called social inten@@ sity syndro@@ me, which tries to account for why guys really pre@@ fer male bon@@ ding over female mat@@ ing."
This is me bo@@ ast@@ ing; I said this public@@ ly in the medi@@ a.
"W@@ e sat there, only understanding that someh@@ ow, Val@@ ent@@ in@@ e's Day -- We sat there, only understanding that someh@@ ow, Val@@ ent@@ in@@ e's Day had ended up with our babies dead, and we didn't know what to do nex@@ t."

"H@@ e's like, ""Y@@ es, De@@ bor@@ ah@@ ?"""
"So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do."
They don't feel different.
"T@@ hat's the technical term for the phenomenon where un@@ fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing data gets lo@@ st, gets un@@ publish@@ ed, is left missing in ac@@ tion, and they say the results described here ""@@ might have provided an early war@@ ning of trouble ahe@@ ad@@ ."""

"@@ It's also the way in which these words are ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ d, the way these words are modi@@ fied and ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ d."

(Laughter) But most people work har@@ d.
And I also was raised with personal examples of leader@@ ship.
(Laughter) The second question was an I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c wor@@ d.
"@@ Th@@ ose stem cells self-@@ organiz@@ ed, and that heart started to be@@ at."
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool@@ .
"@@ Now, how does this compare to a fl@@ y?"
"M@@ e@@ et your cou@@ sin@@ , Th@@ ali@@ a democra@@ tic@@ a."
"So this goes on in the for@@ mal economy as well as the in@@ for@@ mal econom@@ y, so it's wrong of us to bl@@ ame — and I'm not sing@@ ling out S@@ iem@@ ens, I'm saying everyone does it. Oka@@ y?"
"B@@ ecause one thing he did know, that when fa@@ thers are connected to their children, it is less likely that they will re@@ turn@@ ."
"@@ But the years of constant car@@ et@@ ak@@ ing, having to wake up every two hours to turn me, combin@@ ed with them essentially gri@@ ev@@ ing the loss of their son, had taken a tol@@ l on my mother and fa@@ ther."

"W@@ h@@ ile many reasons had led to the Sy@@ ri@@ an war, we shouldn't under@@ estim@@ ate the way in which, by contribut@@ ing to the loss of identity and self-@@ respec@@ t, urban zon@@ ing and mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d, in@@ human@@ e architecture have nur@@ tured sec@@ t@@ arian di@@ vis@@ ions and hat@@ red."
"@@ But this sing@@ le-@@ min@@ de@@ dness will not yiel@@ d the flexi@@ bili@@ ties of mind, the multi@@ p@@ lic@@ ity of perspec@@ tiv@@ es, the capac@@ ities for collabor@@ ation and innovation this country need@@ s."

"@@ I want to close by showing you a vide@@ o@@ ta@@ pe that's a version of a future game in the Rock@@ ett series that our graphic artists and design people put together, that we feel would please that four percent of re@@ vie@@ wer@@ s."
"@@ Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are, wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this@@ ?"
You don't look at it.
It's a place that you get to cre@@ ate.
F@@ ash@@ ion can give us a language for dis@@ s@@ ent.
It's literally the definition of nois@@ e.
"@@ But here's the problem@@ : sometimes patients become resistant to the dru@@ g, and then years after they've been decl@@ ar@@ ed to be cancer fre@@ e, they come back."
"M@@ y father worked par@@ t-@@ time, trained as a teach@@ er, and rose to become a head@@ master at a local primary school."

"A@@ s he says here, most people answer without any h@@ es@@ it@@ ation."
"@@ Now, Ro@@ y Pri@@ ce is not worri@@ ed about getting on the left end of the cur@@ ve, because I think you would have to have some serious brain@@ power to under@@ cut ""@@ To@@ dd@@ l@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as@@ ."""

"@@ And she said, ""Why don't we just stand here and comp@@ li@@ ment each other@@ ?"
"@@ And after talking for many hours about this con@@ tenti@@ ous topic@@ , they also sent a rather un@@ expected ema@@ il."
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
"B@@ y then we had two grand@@ children, S@@ op@@ h@@ ie and Con@@ nor@@ ."
W@@ ater is life.
You don't have an emotional son@@ or@@ ous@@ n@@ ess.
You see it all like this.
"N@@ ex@@ t step@@ , we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them, you know, in the lab at J@@ P@@ L@@ , in what we call our Mars Y@@ ar@@ d."
"O@@ ur technologies are great gi@@ ft@@ s, and we, right now, have the great good fortun@@ e to be living at a time when digital technology is fl@@ our@@ ish@@ ing, when it is bro@@ aden@@ ing and deep@@ ening and becoming more profound all around the world."
They didn't teach it before th@@ en.
We never do.
It's very power@@ ful. It's very excit@@ ing.
"@@ Let me just give you specif@@ ics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it@@ : 1.@@ 2 million Americans have gotten a N@@ ike sho@@ e, which is a body@@ -@@ area network that connec@@ ts the sho@@ e, the sol@@ e of the sho@@ e to the iPh@@ one, or an i@@ Po@@ d."
It's that you've done something that makes people laugh and then think@@ .
"In Africa where I was, I didn't have dr@@ ink@@ able water."
One is not pri@@ me.
"F@@ or millions of years, on the grass@@ lands of Africa, women comm@@ ut@@ ed to work to gather their veget@@ abl@@ es."
It's the same for humans in the gar@@ den of hard@@ ship.
"@@ Now this idea, that what we are, the way to understand ourselves, is as not of some permanent being, which has experienc@@ es, but is kind of a collection of experienc@@ es, might stri@@ ke you as kind of weir@@ d."
"W@@ e@@ 're thro@@ wing a lot more time and money into work@@ sho@@ ps and train@@ ings and mus@@ ic@@ als and plays and school meet@@ ings, all these things to convince people to use the net@@ s we gave you."

"@@ It's us who act as a surro@@ unding community around any conflic@@ t, who can play a construc@@ tive ro@@ le."

"@@ It shows us a general mist@@ r@@ ust of government or govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked institu@@ tions, which l@@ ac@@ ked transpar@@ ency in the pa@@ st."
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.
"L@@ ast year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pol@@ e."
"@@ And today, bre@@ ad now is associated with o@@ bes@@ ity, which is very st@@ ran@@ ge."
"@@ The Sec@@ ur@@ ity Coun@@ cil does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago, when I was there 10 years ago."
The re@@ views with the director turned from the normal look@@ -@@ and-@@ feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and percent@@ ag@@ es.
And I can hold my arm in a particular jo@@ int con@@ figur@@ ation either very st@@ iff or very rel@@ ax@@ ed.
"A@@ nother pri@@ me minister comes in and says, ""No, we have to have an agre@@ ement now, because in 10 minutes, the markets are opening up in Jap@@ an, and there will be ha@@ vo@@ c in the global econom@@ y."""
So how do we do that?
"@@ Gener@@ ally, what you see in green is not deser@@ ti@@ f@@ y@@ ing, and what you see in bro@@ wn is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth."
"T@@ hat's obvi@@ ous, but the ast@@ on@@ ishing thing is, the patient then says, ""Oh my God, my phan@@ tom is moving again, and the pain, the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m, is rel@@ ie@@ v@@ ed."""

"P@@ lease for@@ give us when you transition back to a family who has completely been man@@ eu@@ ver@@ ing without you, and now when you come back, it's not that easy to fall back into a sense of normal@@ ity, because the whole normal has change@@ d."
"O@@ f@@ ten@@ times, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to pri@@ or knowled@@ ge."
So building a machine like the L@@ H@@ C requires countries from all over the world to po@@ ol their resourc@@ es.
P@@ lease raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggres@@ sive at work.
What are the principles that we should adop@@ t in order to avoid repe@@ ating the same mistak@@ es?
It is through art that we can really tell our own story.
So what's he do@@ ing?
A robots revolution is upon us.
Com@@ ing of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely v@@ ital for a free and dynamic society to function proper@@ ly.
"@@ This is so fabul@@ ous@@ ."""
Let's go to the clos@@ est neigh@@ b@@ or to the visible light spectr@@ um -- go to remote control@@ s.
"@@ The surge@@ on is sitting at a con@@ sol@@ e, and controll@@ ing the robot with these controll@@ ers."
"@@ It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one."
"T@@ hat was when I called other girls just like my sist@@ er, who have children, who have been in class but they have for@@ gotten how to read and writ@@ e."
(Laughter) But it shr@@ unk to 60 percent of prim@@ ate gut of my body mas@@ s.
"T@@ hat may have saved the writ@@ ers, but it didn't really save the surge@@ ons terri@@ bly much."
(Laughter) So it wasn't that Que@@ ens@@ land had a particular problem with death@@ s from police shoo@@ t@@ ings and so on.
"G@@ o forward and the estim@@ ates that you have from the E@@ I@@ A and onto the industry estim@@ ates -- the industry knows what they're talking about -- we've got 4@@ ,000 trillion cu@@ bi@@ c feet of natural gas that's available to us."
W@@ hat@@ ?
"L@@ ife can be hard for every@@ one, wherever you live."
But whose responsibility is education in this new world@@ ?
And what could it do if it could look back at us?
Do you ever feel completely overwhel@@ med when you're faced with a complex problem@@ ?
The road turned into the jung@@ le.
"@@ I whi@@ pped out my p@@ en, and I started drawing on her head and I drew a cro@@ wn for her."
as a treatment against consum@@ p@@ tion.
"W@@ e offer high-@@ qual@@ ity, year round sports programs for people with intellectual dis@@ abilities that changes lives and percep@@ tions."
S@@ top it.
"@@ Like this: ta ta tu@@ ck@@ -@@ a tu@@ ck@@ -@@ a ta, ta tu@@ ck@@ -@@ a-@@ tu@@ ck@@ -@@ a-@@ tu@@ ck@@ -@@ a, tu@@ ck@@ -@@ a."
"In much of the developing world, most antibio@@ tics still are."

"@@ Is there any chance that poli@@ tici@@ ans, that the country gener@@ ally, would take a finding like that seri@@ ously and run public policy based on it?"
"@@ And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff."
"@@ If you, for example, have a look at the two main cor@@ rid@@ ors that run through the city -- the yellow and or@@ ange one over here -- this is how they look in an actu@@ al, accurate street map, and this is how they would look in my di@@ stor@@ ted, simp@@ lif@@ ied public tran@@ sport ma@@ p."
I have never once had to use a cell phone there.
And here is the story.
"@@ I'm showing you the number of 15@@ - to 2@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a secon@@ d."
"@@ And there's this famous example of one that was 1,@@ 200 feet long and la@@ sted for two days, and the ants just kept mar@@ ching around and around in a cir@@ cle until they di@@ ed."
So we got some shows off the ground@@ . We started tour@@ ing them internation@@ ally.
I had to tell them every little det@@ ail of everything.
Because you could smoke crack co@@ ca@@ ine -- you can't smoke po@@ w@@ der@@ ed co@@ ca@@ ine -- and smo@@ king is a much more efficient mechanism of deliver@@ ing a high than s@@ nor@@ ting it.
And that is the 40 years that women have ad@@ vo@@ cat@@ ed.
And then poli@@ cy@@ mak@@ ers began to respond to this.
"@@ And it's pretty simple, re@@ ally."
"@@ Syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia is a tra@@ it, like having blue eyes, rather than a dis@@ order because there's nothing wrong."
"In@@ de@@ ed, in the book ""@@ Super@@ intelligen@@ c@@ e"" by the philosoph@@ er N@@ ick Bost@@ ro@@ m, he pick@@ s up on this theme and ob@@ ser@@ ves that a super@@ intelligence might not only be danger@@ ous, it could represent an exist@@ ential threat to all of human@@ ity."
"@@ I know many well-@@ inten@@ tion@@ ed non-@@ Musli@@ ms who@@ 've be@@ gun reading the Kor@@ an, but given up, dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ted by its ""@@ other@@ ness@@ ."""
"@@ And it's an idea that I think is very pre@@ valent at these TED Tal@@ ks, the idea that we can inv@@ ent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis, that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow ne@@ at@@ ly si@@ des@@ te@@ p those energy constrain@@ ts, the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can swe@@ ep all concern@@ s about energy security to one side, the idea that we can step off ne@@ at@@ ly onto a completely ren@@ ew@@ able world."
I picked this up at MI@@ T. It's a little young@@ er.
"@@ And so it's being picked up by people as a market@@ ing advant@@ age, and it's being market@@ ed that way by several countries, including some of our alli@@ ed countries, where they are saying, ""Hey, you can't trust the U.@@ S@@ ., but you can trust our tel@@ ec@@ om company, because we're sa@@ fe@@ ."""
"@@ But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the belief@@ s I hol@@ d, here in the present ten@@ se, suddenly all of this abstract appreci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the windo@@ w -- and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about."
"S@@ o, the thing that we des@@ ig@@ ned, much less sex@@ y but much more human and practic@@ al, was this."
"@@ Now this is what you do, is you ben@@ d both these legs into a tri@@ ang@@ le, and you just wra@@ p some ta@@ pe around."
"@@ Prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al wal@@ ks in, I'm out of a job."
The second my@@ th is a log@@ ical consequ@@ ence of the first.
And we became part of a generation of ad@@ voc@@ ates working with communities facing their own fir@@ es.
"W@@ a@@ iting for others to change their behavior on your behal@@ f, for your survi@@ v@@ al, is a terrible idea."
"B@@ ecause she is a cu@@ b wanting to play, but she was also a pre@@ dat@@ or need@@ ing to kill@@ , and yet conflic@@ ted in some way, because she was also an emerging mo@@ ther."
"@@ I star@@ t, and this is where a child says to me -- and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before, because this is my l@@ ac@@ on@@ ic child@@ ."
"P@@ ut your hand up a little bit hig@@ her, but watch it clo@@ se."
"@@ I am here for you@@ ,"" we can transform in@@ security into secur@@ ity."
"@@ And I started to write down on these little note car@@ ds every time I heard something that struck a ch@@ ord in me, par@@ don the p@@ un, or something that I thought I could use, and pretty so@@ on, my studi@@ o looked like this, kind of like a John N@@ as@@ h, ""@@ Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful M@@ ind@@ "" vi@@ be."
"@@ And because children have their own temp@@ o and intern@@ al clo@@ ck, they don't do quality time, where you sch@@ ed@@ ule 10 minutes for them to open up to you."
So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's lab@@ el@@ ed with fluores@@ cent molecul@@ es.
"@@ It was called ""D@@ ra@@ wing a L@@ ine in Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i@@ ,"" and it showed R@@ oo@@ se@@ v@@ elt with his gun down and his arm out, spar@@ ing the bear@@ 's life, and the be@@ ar was sitting on its h@@ ind legs with these two big, fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed, wide eyes and little ears pri@@ cked up at the top of its head."

"@@ But again, fun is not enough."
"@@ I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call hero@@ es, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, ""Why would you do it?"
"@@ Pri@@ or to that, uni@@ for@@ mit@@ ari@@ an@@ ism was the domin@@ ant paradig@@ m@@ : the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past, there are present@@ -@@ day processes that will explain it."
"@@ The color was@@ hes off the next day, ho@@ wever, for that moment in time, it's their beautiful disrup@@ tion."

"@@ (Laughter) O@@ f course, the other half won@@ '@@ t, right?"

"W@@ hen this picture appear@@ ed, that well-@@ known scientific journ@@ al, The New York Tim@@ es, wrote in its edi@@ tor@@ i@@ al, ""@@ Mars is un@@ interest@@ ing."

"@@ Ge@@ t up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV@@ , go to be@@ d, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV@@ , go to be@@ d, go to par@@ ties on week@@ end@@ s."
I also learn early on that co@@ stum@@ ing can play a key role in this storytell@@ ing.
Mu@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do.
"@@ You can tag pictures of baby animals as happ@@ y, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that dat@@ ab@@ ase, n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating with your feel@@ ings, rather than the key@@ words that just hin@@ t at them."
"@@ They were willing to start at the bottom@@ , just like, say, a fir@@ st-@@ year lawy@@ er at a law fir@@ m is willing to start at the bottom@@ , work 80@@ -@@ hour weeks for not that much money, because they think they're going to make partn@@ er."
"J@@ ust as this happens, my friend rus@@ hes in."
"In a po@@ et's mind, it's a conflict of words, in the univer@@ se@@ 's mind, between day and night."
S@@ ome of the greatest den@@ si@@ ties of some of the most ic@@ on@@ ic and threat@@ en@@ ed species on the planet.
"@@ The person who said five of club@@ s say stop@@ , when the car@@ ds are in the air, right?"
"@@ 9@@ 12 American citizens committed suici@@ de or were mur@@ der@@ ed by family and friends in Gu@@ y@@ ana jung@@ le in 197@@ 8, because they were blind@@ ly o@@ be@@ di@@ ent to this guy, their pa@@ st@@ or -- not their pri@@ est -- their pa@@ stor@@ , Re@@ ver@@ end Jim J@@ on@@ es."

"@@ They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top@@ , after they've bo@@ un@@ ced around, they dis@@ per@@ se into bits and go off into the atmosp@@ here."
"@@ But there is no reason why their dreams -- or min@@ e, for that matter -- are allowed to come true while those of others are turned to night@@ mar@@ es."
We decided to call the mur@@ der@@ er in pris@@ on.
And that is indic@@ ated in the p@@ ink@@ . We have a couple finger@@ ti@@ p surfac@@ es that are lar@@ ger.
"L@@ et's first go to China, where the countr@@ y's largest I@@ .@@ T. service provi@@ der, Ne@@ us@@ of@@ t, has developed a tel@@ em@@ e@@ dic@@ ine solution to help doctors in cities remo@@ tel@@ y treat old and poor patients in Chinese vill@@ ag@@ es."
"@@ This is made of a ti@@ ght mes@@ h of cells which separate blood vess@@ els from the brain, and block everything except for a specific set of partic@@ les, including water molecules and some gas@@ es."
"@@ I'm an intro@@ ver@@ t, but I have a core project, which is to prof@@ ess."
"S@@ o, how did the city respon@@ d?"
O@@ ne@@ 's a fis@@ h.
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.
Where did they get that inspi@@ ration@@ ?
This is something that perhaps Tur@@ k@@ ish A@@ ir@@ lines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign@@ .
(Laughter) Bet@@ ter left und@@ ra@@ wn@@ .
Th@@ ink about that -- that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years.
"B@@ ecause at Pas@@ so@@ ver, when we have to eat un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed bre@@ ad, the ra@@ b@@ bis say, what is the difference between d@@ ough that is made into bre@@ ad, and d@@ ough that is made into un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed bre@@ ad, or ""@@ mat@@ z@@ ah@@ ""@@ ?"
"@@ And sometimes it takes a wa@@ k@@ e-@@ up call@@ , doesn't it, to al@@ ert us to the fact that we're hur@@ rying through our lives, instead of actually living them@@ ; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life."
"H@@ um@@ ans made this air, but it's also the most po@@ tent greenhouse gas that has ever been tes@@ ted."
"@@ (Laughter) If you hit G@@ , lif@@ e's okay, so I always say, ""H@@ it G@@ , and it's going to be all right."
"O@@ ut of no@@ where, B@@ eck We@@ a@@ thers, who we had already been told was dead, stum@@ bled into the ten@@ t, just like a m@@ umm@@ y, he walked into the t@@ ent."
And we will have at least two like that.
"@@ Inter@@ est@@ ingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid@@ ."
(Laughter) (Applause) Mo@@ m laugh@@ ed hy@@ ster@@ ically at this one.
"W@@ ell, the subject of difficult negoti@@ ation re@@ minds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle E@@ ast, of a man who left to his three son@@ s, 17 cam@@ el@@ s."
"@@ But this wasn't quite right ei@@ ther, so in honor of it being discovered by a teles@@ cope in Hawai@@ i, we con@@ sul@@ ted two experts on Hawai@@ ian culture -- a Hawai@@ ian n@@ av@@ ig@@ ator and a l@@ ingu@@ ist -- to pro@@ pose a nam@@ e."
"W@@ here@@ as some people seek safety with their famili@@ es, others attempt pas@@ sage alone and leave their loved ones behind with the hop@@ es of being re@@ un@@ ited later."
"W@@ h@@ ile I was p@@ onder@@ ing this question, I came across this urban le@@ gend about Ern@@ est Hem@@ ing@@ way, who alle@@ ge@@ dly said that these six words her@@ e: ""F@@ or sal@@ e: baby sho@@ es, never wor@@ n@@ ,"" were the best novel he had ever writ@@ ten@@ ."
D@@ on't assume the natural choice is your sp@@ ou@@ se or child@@ .

"E@@ ven once the true cause of my disease is discover@@ ed, if we don't change our institutions and our culture, we will do this again to another disease."
What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of inter@@ faces you can build on top of it.
"@@ It's not sustain@@ able, it's not health@@ y."
It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted song or movie gets p@@ ir@@ ated.
China still has large areas of under@@ development and per capit@@ a income is a better measure of the sophistic@@ ation of the economy.
"@@ (Applause) And like the General As@@ sem@@ bl@@ y, obviously the most wonder@@ ful, wonderful mom@@ ent."
"M@@ a@@ ybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness, but rather a story of vic@@ tory and tri@@ um@@ ph@@ , of a v@@ ali@@ ant bat@@ tle and, eventu@@ ally, a gra@@ ce@@ ful re@@ tre@@ at, a story that ac@@ knowled@@ ges that not even the greatest general defe@@ ats every fo@@ e, that no doctor has ever succe@@ ed@@ ed in making anyone im@@ mortal@@ , and that no wi@@ fe, no matter how hard she tri@@ ed, has ever stopped even the bra@@ ves@@ t, wit@@ ti@@ est and most ma@@ d@@ den@@ ingly lo@@ v@@ able husband from d@@ ying when it was his time to go."

"@@ This whole idea of a city not being a picture is, I think, something that art, in a sense, always was working with."
"@@ But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they want."

"F@@ our years ago here at TED@@ , R@@ ay Kurz@@ weil and I started a new univers@@ ity called Sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity Universit@@ y."
(Applause) There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your atten@@ tion.
"@@ And New@@ ton@@ 's Th@@ ir@@ d La@@ w states that for every ac@@ tion, there is an equal and opposite reac@@ tion."

"@@ But the year Don@@ na changed the men@@ us, the B@@ ears not only won their di@@ vis@@ ion, they went on to win the state champ@@ ion@@ ship, be@@ ating the P@@ each Coun@@ ty Tro@@ j@@ ans 2@@ 8@@ -@@ 14@@ ."
"In my own life, I sh@@ all always be grateful for having found a form of play in my ir@@ rational love of bas@@ eb@@ all."
"So I was thinking, but when you look at the past, the way to understand the past is only by the tra@@ ces available, because we cannot go back [@@ to@@ ] the pa@@ st."
"So open primar@@ ies would make that problem much, much less sever@@ e."
"@@ And as you think of that, what it means is potentially you can re@@ build a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells."
"@@ (Laughter) F@@ or us humans, who are earth@@ bo@@ und, birds represent freed@@ om@@ ."
"@@ And whatever the short@@ -@@ run price for taking action on climate change or on security, or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education, these are pri@@ ces that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries."

"@@ But I think his son will understand this, and will have no sense of g@@ ru@@ d@@ ge, or sense of being neg@@ lec@@ ted, I think@@ ."
Let's start from this moment.
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a cour@@ ty@@ ard th@@ en.
"@@ People who support me and all other tr@@ ans people whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ te@@ dly are often so scar@@ ed to say to wrong thing, so em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed to not know what they think they shou@@ ld, that they never ask@@ ."
"S@@ ome time ago, I cap@@ tured several ways of sound to hit side wall@@ s."
"@@ The way you measure n@@ ano@@ technology is in n@@ an@@ omet@@ ers, and one n@@ an@@ ometer is a billi@@ on@@ th of a met@@ er, and to put some scale to that, if you had a n@@ ano@@ particle that was one n@@ an@@ ometer th@@ ick, and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the wid@@ th of a human hair@@ ."
(Laughter) But the upside for middle bor@@ ns is that they also tend to develop den@@ ser and rich@@ er relationships outside the home.
We're going to have this un@@ limited number of worlds you can explore here.
"S@@ o, ye@@ ah@@ ."
The tran@@ sist@@ or was a small plastic un@@ it that would take us from a world of static bri@@ cks p@@ il@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ activ@@ e.
"E@@ ach incre@@ ment gets a seri@@ al number and a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate, and then the bre@@ wer@@ s and others buy those cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates as a way to return water to these degra@@ ded eco@@ system@@ s."
Because I found out -- we had a number of years at U@@ C@@ L@@ A where we didn't lose a gam@@ e.
Why bo@@ ther@@ ?
"@@ A few years later, I was at my next research job at Geor@@ gi@@ a Te@@ ch in Atlan@@ ta, and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musici@@ ans."
So this whole project was an experim@@ ent.
They are women and men who are prepar@@ ing themselves not for the comfortable predic@@ t@@ ability of y@@ ester@@ day but also for the real@@ ities of today and all of those unknown possibili@@ ties of tomorro@@ w.
So I sc@@ rap@@ ed it off.
"@@ And I spoke to other exper@@ ts, and they said the p@@ inst@@ ri@@ pe suit -- classi@@ c psych@@ op@@ ath -- speak@@ s to it@@ ems one and two on the che@@ ck@@ list@@ : gli@@ b@@ ness, su@@ perf@@ icial char@@ m and gran@@ di@@ ose sense of self-@@ wor@@ th."
"@@ This is a very serious research, that you should read the under@@ lin@@ e."

"@@ He said, ""You don't say@@ !"""
"In her es@@ say, ""The Wh@@ ite Alb@@ um@@ ,"" Jo@@ an Di@@ di@@ on writ@@ es, ""We tell ourselves stories in order to live."

"@@ I'm in this for the long r@@ un, and I would be great@@ ly hon@@ or@@ ed and excited if you'll come on this journey with me."
"@@ The image is terrif@@ y@@ ing, but you quickly come to understand it's not real@@ ."
So you take this enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted vote home as your recei@@ p@@ t.
"@@ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertain@@ ment, yet their cou@@ rage and tal@@ ent brought them through@@ ."
"So while we humans have made great progress in our rel@@ ent@@ less pur@@ suit of spe@@ ed, it turns out that nature was there fir@@ st."
"W@@ ell, we've seen good results so far@@ ."
As w@@ ages increase that also lif@@ ts the bur@@ den on the poor and the working cl@@ as@@ s.
"W@@ e know that kids spend a lot of time behind scre@@ ens today, whether it's television or computer games or what@@ not."
"W@@ hen you're a@@ wa@@ ke, you know you're a@@ wa@@ k@@ e."
"@@ And there he is, with this horri@@ ble electrical box on his r@@ ump in this fantast@@ ic, decre@@ p@@ it pal@@ ac@@ e."
But perhaps the most challeng@@ ing part was to convince the regul@@ ators -- a matter which was deb@@ ated in the par@@ li@@ ament -- that a young female surge@@ on be allowed the opportunity to pion@@ e@@ er for her country.
"@@ And beyond the walls of our lab, we're even beginning to see sign@@ s of change in society."

"@@ (Applause) Now, I'm an arti@@ st."
"@@ And I do think that in a few years, people will be comfortable getting by themselves in a self-@@ pilo@@ ted, electri@@ c@@ , V@@ T@@ O@@ L air ta@@ xi@@ ."
There's a lot of ways to do this with dat@@ a.
"W@@ e had to take them out, which we did."
I was a foreign cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Middle East repor@@ ting for A@@ B@@ C New@@ s.

"@@ It's the only thre@@ at, the only influence that the re@@ e@@ f had to deal with."
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English@@ .
"T@@ wo@@ -S@@ i@@ x, this is T@@ wo@@ -S@@ i@@ x, we're mo@@ bi@@ le."
Thank you.
And we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mix@@ ture.
"@@ I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world."

"W@@ e had A@@ ir@@ Dynam@@ is@@ is, who, like I, did not want to work for a@@ ero@@ space companies on some big, many year project, and so we did our small projec@@ ts, and the company slowly gre@@ w."
