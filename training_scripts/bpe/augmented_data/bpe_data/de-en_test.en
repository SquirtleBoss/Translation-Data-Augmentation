"H@@ il@@ le@@ l stood on one le@@ g and said, ""@@ That which is hate@@ ful to you, do not do to your neighbor@@ . That is the Tor@@ ah@@ . The rest is com@@ ment@@ ar@@ y."
(Laughter) And one night my daughter E@@ den came to me.
"It's known by some people in New Ha@@ v@@ en, obvi@@ ously, but it is not gener@@ ally know@@ n."
"H@@ er de@@ faul@@ t position to@@ ward me, as an Afric@@ an, was a kind of pat@@ ron@@ iz@@ ing, well-@@ meaning p@@ ity."
Now several people at this con@@ ference have already sugges@@ ted that fruit flies could serve neuro@@ science because they're a simple model of brain fun@@ ction.
"Re@@ c@@ ently I took my family -- we do these rather kind of ner@@ dy mathema@@ tical tri@@ ps, which my family lo@@ ve."
"I was ke@@ en to do it, could not con@@ vin@@ ce Bon@@ o."
We cannot wait for them to learn how to be bra@@ ve like I did when I was 3@@ 3 years old.
"I brought it to Paul M@@ ac@@ C@@ read@@ y's company A@@ ero@@ Vir@@ on@@ ment to do a fe@@ asi@@ bility stud@@ y, and they analy@@ zed it, and came up with a lot of innov@@ ative ideas about how to pro@@ pel it."
"L@@ it@@ tle girl@@ : When I watch TV@@ , it's just some shows that you just -- that are pret@@ end."
And that's the ke@@ y: it's about power.
Sometimes I hear stories of bodies that fall off an airplan@@ e.
"Now, here come two more people, and immediately af@@ ter, three more people."
"The da@@ ir@@ y business in Ken@@ ya is a $@@ 4@@ 6@@ 3 million business, and the difference between a sub@@ s@@ ist@@ ence far@@ mer and an ab@@ und@@ ance far@@ mer is only a couple of li@@ ters of milk a day."
"The really sad thing is, in many parts of the world, we're raised to believe that str@@ anger@@ s are dangerous by de@@ faul@@ t, that we can't trust them, that they might hur@@ t us."
(Applause) I wrote this next po@@ em for my mother.
(Applause) U@@ E@@ : Thank you very much.
So oil and pe@@ tro@@ chemic@@ als are not just a problem when there's a sp@@ ill@@ ; they're a problem when there's no@@ t.
And do you remember the respon@@ se@@ ?
"This object was made by a hom@@ in@@ id ancest@@ or, Homo ere@@ ctu@@ s or Homo erg@@ ast@@ er, between 50,000 and 100@@ ,000 years before language."
"There's something I'm developing here called social inten@@ s@@ ity syn@@ dro@@ me, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bon@@ ding over female mat@@ ing."
This is me bo@@ ast@@ ing@@ ; I said this publi@@ c@@ ly in the media.
"We sat there, only understanding that some@@ ho@@ w, V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ e's Da@@ y -- We sat there, only understanding that some@@ ho@@ w, V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ e's Da@@ y had ended up with our babies de@@ ad, and we didn't know what to do ne@@ x@@ t."
The gene he@@ igh@@ tens norm@@ ally occur@@ ring conne@@ ctions between the taste area in his fron@@ tal lo@@ be and the color area further back.
"Th@@ ose manufac@@ tur@@ ers can then sell those medicin@@ es at much lower cost to people who need access to them, to treatment programs that need access to them."
"And then things get really hor@@ ri@@ ble, as his skin ri@@ ps a@@ par@@ t, and he sees a vir@@ us coming out from his in@@ si@@ des."
"H@@ e's like, ""@@ Y@@ es, De@@ bor@@ ah@@ ?"""
"So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do."
They don't feel different.
"That's the techn@@ ical term for the phenomen@@ on where un@@ flat@@ tering data gets lo@@ st, gets un@@ publi@@ she@@ d, is left missing in ac@@ tion, and they say the results descri@@ bed here ""@@ might have provi@@ ded an early war@@ ning of trou@@ ble a@@ head@@ ."""
"And as the number of people who are ol@@ der, above re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age and getting ol@@ der, as they incre@@ a@@ se, there will be less people to take care of them."
And connection is a critical part of being hum@@ an.
We are young until we are no@@ t.
"It's also the way in which these words are arran@@ ge@@ d, the way these words are modi@@ fied and arran@@ ge@@ d."
You see the ide@@ a@@ ?
(Laughter) But most people work hard.
And I also was raised with personal examples of leader@@ ship.
(Laughter) The second question was an I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c wor@@ d.
"Th@@ ose st@@ em cells self-@@ organi@@ ze@@ d, and that heart started to be@@ at."
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.
"Now, how does this comp@@ are to a fl@@ y?"
"Me@@ et your cou@@ sin@@ , Tha@@ li@@ a democra@@ tic@@ a."
"So this goes on in the for@@ mal economy as well as the in@@ for@@ mal econom@@ y, so it's wrong of us to bl@@ ame — and I'm not sing@@ ling out Sie@@ men@@ s, I'm saying everyone does it. Oka@@ y?"
"Because one thing he did know, that when fa@@ thers are connected to their children, it is less likely that they will retur@@ n."
"But the years of constant care@@ tak@@ ing, having to wake up every two hours to turn me, combin@@ ed with them essentially gri@@ ev@@ ing the loss of their son, had taken a toll on my mother and fa@@ ther."
So my journey in aut@@ ism really started when I lived in a res@@ identi@@ al un@@ it for adul@@ ts with aut@@ is@@ m.
"Wh@@ ile many reasons had led to the Sy@@ ri@@ an war, we shouldn't under@@ estim@@ ate the way in which, by contri@@ but@@ ing to the loss of identi@@ ty and self-@@ respe@@ ct, urban z@@ on@@ ing and mis@@ gu@@ ide@@ d, in@@ human@@ e architecture have nur@@ tu@@ red sect@@ arian di@@ visi@@ ons and ha@@ tre@@ d."
"But this sing@@ le-@@ min@@ de@@ dness will not y@@ iel@@ d the flexi@@ bili@@ ties of mind, the multi@@ pli@@ city of perspectiv@@ es, the capac@@ i@@ ties for collabor@@ ation and innovation this country need@@ s."
And so that in a way is the ultim@@ ate leg@@ acy of this ma@@ p.
"Our models have hundreds of thousands of gri@@ d box@@ es calcul@@ ating hundreds of vari@@ ables e@@ ach, on minute tim@@ es@@ cal@@ es."

"Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are, wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this@@ ?"
You don't look at it.
It's a place that you get to cre@@ ate.
Fashion can give us a language for dis@@ s@@ ent.
It's literally the definition of no@@ ise.
"But here's the problem@@ : sometimes patients become resist@@ ant to the dru@@ g, and then years after they've been decl@@ ar@@ ed to be cancer fre@@ e, they come back."

I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
"By then we had two grand@@ children, S@@ op@@ h@@ ie and C@@ onn@@ or."
Water is life.
You don't have an emotional son@@ or@@ ous@@ ness.
You see it all like this.
"N@@ ex@@ t step@@ , we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them, you know, in the lab at J@@ P@@ L@@ , in what we call our Mars Y@@ ar@@ d."

They didn't teach it before th@@ en.
We never do.
It's very power@@ ful. It's very exciting.
"Le@@ t me just give you specific@@ s about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it@@ : 1.@@ 2 million Americans have gotten a Ni@@ ke sho@@ e, which is a bod@@ y-@@ area network that connects the sho@@ e, the sol@@ e of the sho@@ e to the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e, or an iPo@@ d."
It's that you've done something that makes people laugh and then think.
"In Africa where I was, I didn't have drin@@ k@@ able water."
One is not pri@@ me.
"For millions of years, on the gra@@ ss@@ lands of Africa, women comm@@ u@@ ted to work to ga@@ ther their vegetab@@ l@@ es."
It's the same for humans in the garden of hard@@ ship.
"Now this ide@@ a, that what we are, the way to understand oursel@@ ves, is as not of some perman@@ ent bein@@ g, which has experienc@@ es, but is kind of a collection of experienc@@ es, might stri@@ ke you as kind of weir@@ d."

"And today, bread now is associated with o@@ bes@@ ity, which is very str@@ ange@@ ."
"The Se@@ cur@@ ity Coun@@ cil does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago, when I was there 10 years ago."
The re@@ views with the dire@@ ctor turned from the normal loo@@ k@@ -@@ and-@@ feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and perc@@ ent@@ a@@ ges.
And I can hold my arm in a particular jo@@ int con@@ fig@@ u@@ ration either very sti@@ ff or very relaxed.
"Another pri@@ me min@@ ister comes in and says, ""N@@ o, we have to have an agre@@ ement now, because in 10 minut@@ es, the markets are opening up in Jap@@ an, and there will be ha@@ vo@@ c in the global econom@@ y."""
So how do we do that?
"@@ Gener@@ ally, what you see in green is not deser@@ ti@@ f@@ y@@ ing, and what you see in bro@@ wn is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Ear@@ th."

"O@@ f@@ ten@@ times, we think that we have to rel@@ ate new knowledge to pri@@ or knowled@@ ge."

What are the princi@@ ples that we should adop@@ t in order to avoid repe@@ ating the same mistak@@ es?
It is through art that we can really tell our own story.
So what's he do@@ ing?
A robots revolution is upon us.
Com@@ ing of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely v@@ ital for a free and dynam@@ ic society to function proper@@ ly.
"This is so f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous@@ ."""
Let's go to the clo@@ s@@ est neighb@@ or to the visible light spec@@ tr@@ um -- go to re@@ mo@@ te contro@@ l@@ s.

"That was when I called other girls just like my sister@@ , who have children, who have been in class but they have for@@ gotten how to read and writ@@ e."
(Laughter) But it shr@@ unk to 60 percent of pri@@ mate gut of my body mas@@ s.
"That may have sa@@ ved the writ@@ ers, but it didn't really save the surge@@ ons terri@@ bly much."
(Laughter) So it wasn't that Que@@ ens@@ land had a particular problem with death@@ s from police shoo@@ t@@ ings and so on.
"G@@ o forward and the estim@@ ates that you have from the E@@ I@@ A and onto the industry estim@@ ates -- the industry knows what they're talking about -- we've got 4@@ ,000 trillion cu@@ bi@@ c feet of natural gas that's available to us."

The road turned into the jung@@ le.

"I@@ s there any chance that poli@@ tici@@ ans, that the country gener@@ ally, would take a finding like that seri@@ ously and run public policy based on it?"
"And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is, because it's never done, you have to do all this other stuff."
"If you, for example, have a look at the two main cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors that run through the city -- the yellow and orange one over here -- this is how they look in an actu@@ al, accur@@ ate street ma@@ p, and this is how they would look in my d@@ istor@@ ted, simpli@@ fied public transport ma@@ p."
I have never once had to use a cell phone there.
And here is the story.
"I'm showing you the number of 15@@ - to 2@@ 4@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a secon@@ d."
"And there's this famous example of one that was 1,@@ 200 feet long and last@@ ed for two days, and the ants just kept mar@@ ching around and around in a cir@@ cle until they di@@ ed."
So we got some shows off the ground. We started tour@@ ing them internation@@ ally.
I had to tell them every little de@@ tail of everything.
Because you could smo@@ ke cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine -- you can't smo@@ ke po@@ w@@ der@@ ed co@@ ca@@ ine -- and smo@@ king is a much more efficient mechan@@ ism of deli@@ ver@@ ing a high than sn@@ orting it.
And that is the 40 years that women have advoc@@ ated.
And then poli@@ cy@@ ma@@ kers began to respond to this.
"And it's pretty simp@@ le, re@@ ally."
"S@@ yn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia is a tra@@ it, like having blue ey@@ es, rather than a dis@@ order because there's nothing wron@@ g."
"In@@ de@@ ed, in the book ""@@ Super@@ intelligen@@ ce@@ "" by the phi@@ losop@@ her N@@ ick Bo@@ stro@@ m, he pick@@ s up on this theme and obser@@ ves that a super@@ intelligence might not only be danger@@ ous, it could represent an exist@@ enti@@ al thre@@ at to all of human@@ ity."

I picked this up at MI@@ T@@ . It's a little yo@@ ung@@ er.
"And so it's being picked up by people as a marke@@ ting advan@@ ta@@ ge, and it's being marke@@ ted that way by several countries, including some of our al@@ lied countries, where they are saying, ""Hey, you can't trust the U.@@ S@@ ., but you can trust our tele@@ co@@ m compan@@ y, because we're safe@@ ."""
"But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the belief@@ s I hol@@ d, here in the present ten@@ se, suddenly all of this abstra@@ ct appreci@@ ation of fal@@ li@@ bility goes out the window -- and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about."
"So, the thing that we desig@@ ne@@ d, much less sex@@ y but much more human and practic@@ al, was this."
"Now this is what you do, is you bend both these legs into a tri@@ ang@@ le, and you just wra@@ p some ta@@ pe aro@@ und."
"P@@ rin@@ ci@@ p@@ al walks in, I'm out of a job@@ ."
The second my@@ th is a log@@ ical consequ@@ ence of the fir@@ st.
And we became part of a generation of advoc@@ ates working with communities fac@@ ing their own fir@@ es.
"W@@ a@@ iting for others to change their behavior on your be@@ hal@@ f, for your survi@@ val@@ , is a terrible ide@@ a."
"Because she is a cu@@ b wan@@ ting to pla@@ y, but she was also a pre@@ da@@ tor need@@ ing to kill@@ , and yet confli@@ cted in some way, because she was also an em@@ erg@@ ing mo@@ ther."
"I star@@ t, and this is where a child says to me -- and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before, because this is my l@@ ac@@ onic chil@@ d."
"P@@ ut your hand up a little bit high@@ er, but watch it clo@@ se."
"I am here for you@@ ,"" we can transform in@@ security into secur@@ ity."
"And I started to write down on these little no@@ te car@@ ds every time I heard something that stru@@ ck a ch@@ ord in me, par@@ don the p@@ un, or something that I thought I could use@@ , and pretty so@@ on, my studi@@ o looked like this, kind of like a John N@@ as@@ h, ""@@ Beau@@ ti@@ ful Min@@ d@@ "" vi@@ be."
"And because children have their own temp@@ o and intern@@ al clo@@ ck, they don't do quality time, where you sche@@ du@@ le 10 minutes for them to open up to you."
So that's the beauty of having a tum@@ or that's lab@@ el@@ ed with flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent molecul@@ es.

"And they influ@@ enc@@ ed that, and this next pie@@ ce, which I'll do a little se@@ g@@ ment of."
"But again, fun is not enough@@ ."
"I've had the great hon@@ or of getting to meet some of thes@@ e, who we would call hero@@ es, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, ""Why would you do it?"
"P@@ ri@@ or to that, uni@@ for@@ mit@@ ari@@ an@@ ism was the domin@@ ant par@@ a@@ dig@@ m@@ : the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the pa@@ st, there are present@@ -@@ day process@@ es that will explain it."

"(Laughter) O@@ f course, the other half won@@ 't, right?"

"This spirit was ep@@ it@@ om@@ ized by a single wall in our small, two-@@ bedro@@ om apartment on the South S@@ ide of Chic@@ ago."
It has to do with weigh@@ ing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statis@@ tical eviden@@ ce.

The English language is as big as it is.
"H@@ o@@ wever, if the training sets aren't really that diver@@ se, any face that de@@ vi@@ ates too much from the establi@@ shed nor@@ m will be harder to dete@@ ct, which is what was happening to me."

"F@@ our@@ th, sometimes try the hard way."
"I could no longer go to school, see my friends or even eat out, because my tics would attra@@ ct the attention of everyone in the room."

And she turned that audience around on a p@@ in.
They're helping us find the news. They're helping us figure out what is the best an@@ gle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear@@ .
But it's the combination of those two things that gets me really excited about what I do.
"That sounds abstra@@ ct, but for us it's quite practic@@ al."
"So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different building Bu@@ zz@@ car than it was building Z@@ i@@ p@@ car, because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that I have to be thinking ab@@ out@@ : the ow@@ ners who are going to provide the cars and the driver@@ s who are going to r@@ ent them."

"They said, ""@@ Y@@ es@@ ."" I said, ""@@ All right, let's pra@@ y."""
"And he clo@@ ses the do@@ or, and the whole room is now filled with smo@@ ke."
"So you see, no matter how popular and successful a public space may be, it can never be taken for gran@@ ted."
"As Bor@@ a@@ q@@ ch@@ in steps out@@ side, she@@ ’s gre@@ e@@ ted by a com@@ mo@@ tion – her un@@ wanted vis@@ it@@ or is now running cir@@ cles around her ste@@ war@@ ds."

"The interesting thing is that intui@@ tive e@@ at@@ ers are less likely to be over@@ we@@ ight, and they spend less time thinking about food."
"(Laughter) Having seen how our dreams of democracy and how our dreams of co@@ exist@@ ence were cr@@ ushed in Tur@@ ke@@ y, both gradu@@ ally but also with a be@@ wil@@ der@@ ing spe@@ ed, over the years I've felt quite de@@ morali@@ ze@@ d."
"And as the des@@ c@@ end@@ ants of these explor@@ ers, we have their no@@ ma@@ di@@ c blood cour@@ sing through our own v@@ ein@@ s."
"Now, this is completely un@@ pro@@ mp@@ te@@ d; she had never seen this done before."
"One is the Western world, defin@@ ed mostly by Western Europe and the United Stat@@ es, has made an aw@@ ful lot of progres@@ s."
"E@@ S: When we think about in terms of how far we can go, I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it."
"O@@ K. Now, what can you do@@ ?"
"Well, we already saw an@@ e@@ c@@ do@@ t@@ ally a couple of sign@@ s that they m@@ igh@@ t."
So what did we fin@@ d?
"And it tries its har@@ dest to help us change our behavi@@ or, to help us stop smo@@ king, to help us stop eating that second, that thir@@ d, that fourth cook@@ ie."
"And there are a series of behavi@@ ors that we@@ ’@@ ve lear@@ n@@ t as kid@@ s, and that turn out to be quite useful to us as desig@@ ner@@ s."
"The key to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating small@@ po@@ x was early dete@@ ction, early respon@@ se."
"Y@@ es, it's better to make more money rather than les@@ s, or to graduate from college instead of dro@@ pping out, but the differences in happiness tend to be sm@@ all."
And that leads to a really interesting idea.
There are a lot of ways you can describe this.
"Well, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple sna@@ il, about the size of a p@@ ing-@@ p@@ ong ball@@ , an a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c ga@@ stro@@ po@@ d."
"It's something that has now been rep@@ lic@@ ated internation@@ ally, and while I am not saying it's easy -- believe me, it's no@@ t."
"If you think the one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is S@@ w@@ ing, cla@@ p your hand@@ s."

"They cri@@ ed as their father sig@@ ned over tempor@@ ary cu@@ sto@@ dy to their Ch@@ op@@ Art ment@@ or, Er@@ in, without even allowing them to take an extra pair of cloth@@ es on their way out."
"For example, in New Or@@ le@@ ans we have Ca@@ ju@@ n Chinese food, where they serve S@@ ich@@ u@@ an al@@ li@@ g@@ ator and sweet and s@@ our craw@@ fis@@ h."
"Fin@@ ally, I discovered that some people knew about this -- often military psych@@ i@@ at@@ ris@@ ts -- and that what we were dealing with was called trau@@ ma."
"B@@ asi@@ cally this is a micro@@ -@@ contro@@ ll@@ er with a few extra compon@@ ents that can be shi@@ pped for very little cost across the world, and that's what is all requi@@ red with a little bit of local tin@@ ker@@ ing talent to conver@@ t the dev@@ ice into something else."

"And that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then dri@@ ft up."
They found no@@ thing.
"This male sna@@ ke, 12 feet long, met another male king co@@ bra@@ ."
"And now it turned into something much, much broa@@ der as a problem, and it has to do with performan@@ ce."
"But for me, absolutely the best point is, there is no anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ation therap@@ y requi@@ red."
"I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to constru@@ ct genu@@ in@@ ely sustainable hom@@ es and cities is by conne@@ cting them to nature, not insul@@ ating them from it."
This is not a supp@@ le@@ ment@@ ary vit@@ am@@ in for the soul.
A final examp@@ le: Ko@@ so@@ vo@@ .
"So, they provi@@ ded a bus that held 60 people and dro@@ ve the three of them back and for@@ th several hours to Lar@@ am@@ ie."
"It's like education is an industri@@ al process that can be impro@@ ved just by having better data, and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy ma@@ kers is this idea that if we fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ e it well enough, if we just get it right, it will all h@@ um along perfectly into the futu@@ re."
A@@ s@@ k yourself where you learned to as@@ sign the meaning of wrong or ab@@ normal to doing many things.
"I do run a kind of a business -- I've got 1@@ 20 people and you've got to pay them, so there's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with, I think, a healthy in@@ secur@@ ity."
B@@ ack to some of the more m@@ und@@ ane issues of thinking about un@@ certain@@ ty.
So that was the reason for the project.
Ab@@ out five percent of the world has significant hearing los@@ s.
Because there is no bound@@ ary.
"W@@ hat's the form@@ ul@@ a that we can use in any situation to deter@@ mine what we should do, whether we should use that gu@@ y's data or no@@ t?"
"I took it back to the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on after it got dec@@ lassi@@ fie@@ d, when the pat@@ ent issu@@ ed, and told the people back there about it, and they laug@@ he@@ d, and then I took them back a dem@@ o and they bou@@ gh@@ t."
"(Applause) A city that in the 19@@ 50@@ s was the world's industri@@ al gi@@ ant, with a population of 1.@@ 8 million people and 1@@ 40 squ@@ are miles of land and infra@@ structure, used to support this bo@@ om@@ ing, M@@ id@@ wes@@ tern urban c@@ enter@@ ."
"We coul@@ d, of course, buy more effici@@ enc@@ y."
They're going to be ta@@ pping into carbon cre@@ dit@@ s.
"One day, they anger@@ ed the go@@ ds, and Ze@@ us s@@ lic@@ ed them all in two@@ ."
"But trust me, I work in adver@@ tis@@ ing."
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.
"And yet many Dar@@ win@@ i@@ ans are an@@ xi@@ ous, a little un@@ easy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Dar@@ win@@ ism go@@ es."
And this spread@@ s on out end@@ less@@ ly into a distance.
"(Laughter) This time, I'm going to talk about mental ill@@ ness."
"He said, ""O@@ ka@@ y."""
"So in order to have a conscious mind, you have a self within the conscious mind."
"It is one thing, actually, that you don't need to wait for anyone to do, so do it."
"If it di@@ dn@@ ’t have the model keeping track of the bod@@ y@@ ’s si@@ ze, sha@@ pe, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly in@@ j@@ ure oursel@@ ves."
"But now, the fact that it's also a good ex@@ plan@@ ation, hard to var@@ y, makes the cru@@ cial differ@@ ence."
"H@@ en@@ ry, by contra@@ st, is born at ter@@ m, so he's born on Mar@@ ch 1, 19@@ 80@@ ."
"It's been around for over 50 years, which means that in my life@@ time, I have never lived one day of peace in my country."
That's still just one percent of the total popul@@ ation.
There weren't really many materials or things to use@@ .
The same holds true on the other end of the economic spec@@ tr@@ um.
"And in the Ma@@ as@@ a@@ i community, go@@ ats and co@@ ws are the most valu@@ ed po@@ ss@@ es@@ sion@@ ."
The sun is over@@ head there. Summer ra@@ ins in sou@@ thern Africa.
It could be a sol@@ e for a sports sho@@ e.
"In fact, you're not even allowed to stand where this gentle@@ man is stand@@ ing, at the fo@@ am@@ ing, sli@@ pper@@ y wat@@ ers at the th@@ res@@ hol@@ d."

"The difficult answer is, we did it to oursel@@ ves."
"I've seen him lose his intelle@@ ct, his sense of hum@@ or, his language skill@@ s, but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my son@@ s, he loves my brother and my mom and his care@@ gi@@ ver@@ s."
"And with the help of 100 volunte@@ ers, over a week, created this fair@@ ly fl@@ oral ty@@ po@@ graph@@ y that sp@@ el@@ led, ""O@@ bs@@ es@@ sions make my life worse and my work bet@@ ter@@ ."""
"We find life at the bottom of every long-@@ ter@@ m, long-@@ distance dri@@ ll@@ ing core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the po@@ res of that ro@@ ck."
"OK, you ta@@ p, ""D@@ on@@ e"" and it will find out the song and play it for you."
"Most don't take long, less than two minutes e@@ ach@@ ."
E@@ igh@@ ty@@ -@@ five percent is a really big num@@ ber.
"And when you're descri@@ bing your science, be@@ ware of j@@ arg@@ on."
That's how under@@ paid yo@@ ung@@ er-@@ a@@ ged people have to fol@@ d your T-@@ shir@@ t.
"When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same voc@@ ab@@ ular@@ y as you, or share the same set of assum@@ p@@ tions as you, you start to think that that's realit@@ y."
""@@ "You can't su@@ e someone for calling them a c@@ un@@ t."""
"Then of course, the Ira@@ q War@@ , predi@@ cted to cost just 60 billion back in 200@@ 3@@ ."
"Well of course, you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million book@@ s."
"Now, 20@@ 45 happens to be the 100@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary of the bir@@ th of nuclear weap@@ ons in the New Mexic@@ o deser@@ t."
So here we have the other scen@@ ari@@ o.
"I am M@@ r Mich@@ e@@ al Ban@@ gu@@ ra@@ , the son of late M@@ r Tha@@ im@@ u B@@ ang@@ ur@@ a who was the Min@@ ister of Fin@@ ance in S@@ ier@@ r@@ a Le@@ one but was kil@@ led during the civi@@ l war."
And yet we're spending billions of S@@ wis@@ s f@@ r@@ anc@@ s on this problem.
"This uni@@ fic@@ ation model predi@@ cts the exist@@ ence of these two new force partic@@ les, which should act a lot like the wea@@ k force, only weak@@ er."
Lear@@ n to manage it.
"My daugh@@ ters poin@@ ted out that I'm very similar loo@@ king, so this is a bit of a problem."
"And it@@ ’s not just glu@@ co@@ se monit@@ ors and insul@@ in p@@ um@@ ps that have this problem, but all bo@@ di@@ ly im@@ pl@@ ants, at different time scal@@ es."
And so there's a bar@@ code on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is.
I think R@@ ing@@ ling Bro@@ thers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Tim@@ es Maga@@ zin@@ e.
"Every@@ body wanted to show their drug was better than ris@@ per@@ i@@ done, so you see tri@@ als compar@@ ing new anti@@ p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic dru@@ gs against ris@@ per@@ id@@ one at eight milli@@ gra@@ ms a day."

"A@@ ctu@@ ally, most of them."
"After exploring recent@@ l@@ y-@@ aband@@ oned build@@ ings, I felt that everything could fall into ru@@ ins very fast@@ : your home, your off@@ ice, a shopping m@@ all, a church -- any man@@ -@@ made structures around you."
Let's talk about billi@@ ons.
"So, what do I discover when I look at art@@ work@@ s?"
"And short@@ ly there@@ af@@ ter, on Janu@@ ary 19@@ th, they vo@@ ted in the con@@ gres@@ s to am@@ end their con@@ stitu@@ tion to have a con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons."
"When she collected the photos from us, she shared a bit of her story with us."
Al Ja@@ ze@@ er@@ a. C@@ N@@ N. How did we get there?
"And unless I re@@ educ@@ ate myself, I am always going to think that women's stories matter less than men@@ '@@ s."
"E@@ igh@@ ty percent of carbon emis@@ sions come from ci@@ ties, which means cities are in a position to solve the carbon problem, or most of it, whether or not the stat@@ es of which they are a part make agre@@ em@@ ents with one an@@ other."
"We don't have any money, so we can't give them."
So we chose a small spot in the garden.
"(Laughter) (Music) Righ@@ t: I'll be ready in just a min@@ ute, dar@@ l@@ ing."
"(Applause) Y@@ es, maybe just to round off."
"So then we come alon@@ g, we im@@ plant some ma@@ m@@ mali@@ an cells that you can see in blu@@ e."
Here's a S@@ O@@ L@@ E in action.
"I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were every@@ where. You know, it's like a big -- it's come full cir@@ cle@@ ."

When people come to an un@@ familiar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down.
"So te@@ ams of people who are operating the ro@@ vers on Mar@@ s, like this one, what we are doing is we are living on Earth, but working on Mar@@ s."
It's been done in vol@@ es.
(Laughter) M@@ ak@@ es you wonder about ac@@ ade@@ mic@@ s.
"And so we know that, for example, openness and consci@@ enti@@ ous@@ ness are very good predict@@ ors of life succ@@ ess, but the open people achieve that success through being au@@ da@@ ci@@ ous and, occasion@@ ally, od@@ d."
"We swi@@ vel towards each other, we do what we call the ""@@ an@@ ch@@ or@@ ing ga@@ ze@@ "" and we tal@@ k."
Who kil@@ led O@@ sam@@ a bin La@@ den@@ ? The S@@ E@@ A@@ L Team Si@@ x.
No ma@@ sk@@ s ...
It's really a huge challenge.
"They're amazing cre@@ atures that really change how you view the world because they're not that different from us@@ : They're trying to make a liv@@ ing, they're trying to ra@@ ise their off@@ spr@@ ing, they're trying to get on and survive in the world."
"We're going to drive pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce throughout E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh@@ , throughout the U.@@ K@@ ., for Wel@@ sh people."
"Our p@@ act with our pati@@ ents, the Hi@@ p@@ po@@ cra@@ tic O@@ ath and its vari@@ ants, is about the s@@ anc@@ ti@@ ty of the pati@@ ent@@ -@@ doctor relationshi@@ p."
It's a computer program running in the bra@@ in.
"And I have an ac@@ a@@ dem@@ y, a part of the University of F@@ ine Ar@@ ts in Ber@@ lin@@ ."
"So in this di@@ le@@ mm@@ a about re@@ conc@@ iling these two sets of fundamental need@@ s, there are a few things that I've come to understand ero@@ tic cou@@ ples do."
Technology can change our understanding of nature.
"These are compo@@ st to@@ i@@ le@@ ts, and nobody at the school wanted to know about them, especially the princip@@ al."
"But in the midd@@ le, we have most of the world popul@@ ation, and they have now 24 percent of the in@@ com@@ e."
All you can do with brain imag@@ ing is watch regi@@ ons turn on and off as people think different thoughts.
"@@ Like half the anti@@ bio@@ tics in this country are not ad@@ min@@ ister@@ ed to people, but to anim@@ als."
"I mean, companies are all about finding the right people, inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people."
"W@@ here they have no place is where the men are@@ : in the For@@ um, in the La@@ w C@@ our@@ t, or in the Sen@@ ate H@@ ou@@ se."
"That was a very H@@ ung@@ arian thing to do, as anyone will att@@ est who remem@@ bers 195@@ 6@@ ."
"And when I listened to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e, I could hear crack@@ ly sounds on both si@@ des that told me that she was in con@@ ges@@ tive heart fail@@ u@@ re."

"This is not how it work@@ s."""
"(@@ Music) And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Vir@@ tual Cho@@ ir and where we might be able to take this, he challen@@ ged me to push the technology as far as we possibly coul@@ d."
"So knowing that T@@ B@@ I is at the ro@@ ot of so many of these challeng@@ es, the mission for a group of us in Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o has been to dis@@ ru@@ pt that cyc@@ le, to j@@ am the re@@ vol@@ ving the do@@ or."
There are so many other people sharing their stories.
"@@ Radi@@ ation h@@ its whatever you point it at, and your blood stream carries che@@ mo@@ -@@ therape@@ u@@ tics all over your body."
"(@@ D@@ rum@@ s) (Laughter) (@@ D@@ rum@@ s) But before I can do any more dama@@ ge, suddenly we all hear a ""@@ cli@@ ck@@ -@@ cli@@ ck@@ ."""
"Because we don't just enjoy now, we partici@@ pat@@ e."
And we've had some good test@@ s.
"I think self-@@ dis@@ cipl@@ ine is something, it's like a mus@@ cle@@ ."
But the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are quite different.
And that's no m@@ ere hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical examp@@ le.
What do my book@@ shel@@ ves say about me@@ ?
"You know, when an archite@@ ct buil@@ ds a model@@ , he or she is trying to show you a world in min@@ i@@ at@@ u@@ re."
"I hear so many times in the Stat@@ es, ""Well, of course we should deal with obvious proble@@ ms, but if you don't see what's in front of you, you're either dum@@ b or ignor@@ ant@@ ."""
"And I also can find that by imag@@ ining ful@@ ly, and becoming what is imagin@@ ed -- and yet is in that real world, the fic@@ tional world."
Gam@@ ma is a German company that manufac@@ tures surve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce software and s@@ ells it only to govern@@ ments.
"(Applause) Be@@ fore I jo@@ ined Spe@@ cial Olymp@@ ics, I was nerv@@ ous because I was yo@@ ung, sh@@ y, not confident and didn't have many friends."
"And at the heart of su@@ sta@@ ining des@@ ire in a committed relationshi@@ p, I think, is the re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation of two fundamental human need@@ s."
"In the words of Sam@@ u@@ el John@@ son, ""@@ Re@@ marri@@ age is the tri@@ ump@@ h of hope over experienc@@ e."""
"And of course, we may be wrong -- this has@@ n't all been pe@@ er re@@ vie@@ we@@ d, we're in the middle of thinking about it -- but so far@@ , it seems goo@@ d."
So it could be brid@@ ged in infinitely many different ways.
We went on the de@@ ck and turned our tor@@ ches on and off to attra@@ ct the attention of any passing bo@@ at.
"The only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are produc@@ ing, al@@ ways, even if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO@@ 2, are the tre@@ es."
It was actually a terrible dis@@ aster for Pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on.
It's a story made up by a journali@@ st.
"Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share of dy@@ s@@ function -- to mat@@ ch its brilli@@ ance, to be su@@ re."

"It was really all the freedom I know when I'm travel@@ ing, but it also pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly felt like coming home."
I didn't look the par@@ t.
"But starting with a theo@@ re@@ tical form@@ ul@@ ation of a problem can un@@ le@@ as@@ h num@@ er@@ ous opportunities for tes@@ ting hy@@ po@@ thes@@ es and simul@@ ating scen@@ ari@@ os and therape@@ u@@ tic inter@@ ven@@ tions, all in a completely safe way."
But I think they ble@@ w it.
What will this future without secre@@ ts look like@@ ?
"Well, Ton@@ ya is a great example of one of these women."
No@@ !
"And he said, ""Oh, even if there was no@@ thing, you still wouldn't be satisfie@@ d."""
"T@@ hat, of course, is the S@@ la@@ vi@@ c sw@@ am@@ p mer@@ ma@@ i@@ d."
This is pre@@ vent@@ able disea@@ se. Wa@@ ste of life.
"The other way is that your brain is not only taking in electri@@ cal imp@@ ul@@ ses, you're also sending out."
So I want to know what happens to the chron@@ ic pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ at@@ ors.
Some people are starting to ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on a rich@@ er definition of sexu@@ ality.
And I'm thinking they've done more for my marri@@ age than a life@@ time of therap@@ y ever coul@@ d.
"J@@ imm@@ y, you mention@@ ed im@@ par@@ ti@@ ality being a key to Wikipedi@@ a's succ@@ ess."
But you can get on a German I@@ C@@ E train and make it almost to Alb@@ ani@@ a.
It's not fix@@ ed.
"And ever since then, I've wonder@@ ed why it is that capitali@@ sm is so amaz@@ ingly efficient at some things, but so ine@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent at others, why it's so innov@@ ative in some ways and so un@@ -@@ innov@@ ative in others."

"(Laughter) So, over the next min@@ ute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crow@@ d because eventually they would be ridi@@ cu@@ led for not jo@@ ining in."
"The digital revolu@@ tion, y@@ es."
That's not how it works.
"So given all of that and given how dar@@ n neuro@@ tic I am, how do I get any sleep at all@@ ?"
"She is here, I was separ@@ ated from her@@ ."""
That's nice. So what's going to happen ne@@ x@@ t?
We will be using the TV scre@@ ens or their equi@@ val@@ ents for electronic books of the future.
"And one way of thinking about this is that we don't regar@@ d our oce@@ ans as sac@@ red, and we shoul@@ d."
And you can actually say things here that have impac@@ ts around the world.
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.
"So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of thes@@ e."
It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a com@@ et passed over the mounta@@ in. Hy@@ aku@@ ta@@ ke.
I know a woman who's good at this.
It's fun to be foo@@ led.
(Laughter) But I don't know who felt worse that day.
"And he calls them ""Le@@ vel 5 leader@@ s."""
"The ima@@ ger@@ y of God is absolute bein@@ g, absolute awar@@ eness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and lo@@ ve."
I can't wait to see what we TED@@ sters do about this cris@@ is.
But you'll notice that this is a pretty global effect.
"The bus rap@@ id transport system in Bo@@ go@@ t@@ á in Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a is a very important case of how to move around saf@@ ely and quickly in a non-@@ poll@@ ut@@ ing way in a cit@@ y: very frequ@@ ent bus@@ es, strongly protected rout@@ es, the same serv@@ ice, really, as an under@@ ground ra@@ il@@ way system, but much, much che@@ aper and can be done much more quickly, a brilli@@ ant idea in many more cities around the world that's develop@@ ing."
So the early hi@@ p-@@ ho@@ p guys would loo@@ p certain se@@ ctions.
"They can eat up to 400 ki@@ los of food in a day, and they dis@@ per@@ se v@@ ital plant see@@ ds across thousands of kil@@ ome@@ ters during their 50@@ -to-@@ 60@@ -@@ year life sp@@ an."

These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world.
The first is cy@@ an@@ ob@@ ac@@ teri@@ a.
Here's a secre@@ t from the scientific liter@@ ature for you.
"(Laughter) You can see that this bar@@ code is the same family, but it's dist@@ in@@ ct from par@@ a@@ influ@@ enz@@ a-@@ 3, which gives you a very bad col@@ d."

This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way.
"And I know it's se@@ duc@@ tive to stand outside the ar@@ en@@ a, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and k@@ ick some ass when I'm bul@@ let@@ pro@@ of and when I'm perfe@@ ct."
"This is wh@@ y, in ""The Me@@ me Mach@@ ine@@ ,"" I called it me@@ me@@ tic dri@@ ve."
"In order to answer complex questions like that, we need people of different back@@ gro@@ unds -- lab@@ -@@ based scientists and clin@@ ici@@ ans, social work@@ ers and policy ma@@ ker@@ s, ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ ists and human rights activ@@ ists — to work together."
""@@ "I@@ s she ment@@ al@@ ?"" I though@@ t."

Those are the two cho@@ ices I'll give you.

(Music) This project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again but it helped me get my life back.
"@@ Her@@ e, what you see is a picture that shows in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent democra@@ cy."

"And they're allowed to keep trade secre@@ ts, so they don't even give the ingredi@@ ents out."
The problem is that it was working in the lower rank@@ s of the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ la@@ .

We decided to call the mur@@ der@@ er in pris@@ on.
And that is indic@@ ated in the p@@ in@@ k. We have a couple fing@@ er@@ ti@@ p surfac@@ es that are lar@@ ger.
"Let's first go to China, where the countr@@ y's largest I@@ .@@ T@@ . service provi@@ der, Ne@@ us@@ of@@ t, has developed a tele@@ medicine solution to help doctors in cities re@@ mo@@ tely treat old and poor patients in Chinese villa@@ ges."
"This is made of a ti@@ ght mes@@ h of cells which separate blood ves@@ sel@@ s from the brain, and blo@@ ck everything except for a specific set of partic@@ les, including water molecules and some gas@@ es."
"I'm an introver@@ t, but I have a core project, which is to profes@@ s."
"So, how did the city respon@@ d?"
O@@ ne@@ 's a fis@@ h.
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.
Where did they get that inspi@@ ration@@ ?
This is something that perhaps Tur@@ k@@ ish Air@@ lines should have studied a bit more care@@ fully before they ran this campa@@ ig@@ n.
(Laughter) Bet@@ ter left und@@ ra@@ w@@ n.
Th@@ ink about that -- that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years.
"Because at Pas@@ so@@ ver, when we have to eat un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed b@@ read@@ , the ra@@ b@@ bis say, what is the difference between dou@@ gh that is made into b@@ read@@ , and dou@@ gh that is made into un@@ lea@@ ven@@ ed b@@ read@@ , or ""@@ mat@@ z@@ ah@@ ""@@ ?"
"And sometimes it takes a wa@@ ke-@@ up c@@ all, doesn't it, to al@@ ert us to the fact that we're h@@ urr@@ ying through our lives, instead of actually living them@@ ; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life."
"H@@ um@@ ans made this air@@ , but it's also the most po@@ tent gre@@ en@@ house gas that has ever been tes@@ ted."
"(Laughter) If you hit G@@ , life@@ 's okay, so I always say, ""H@@ it G@@ , and it's going to be all right."
"O@@ ut of no@@ where, Be@@ ck We@@ a@@ ther@@ s, who we had already been told was de@@ ad, stum@@ bled into the t@@ ent, just like a m@@ umm@@ y, he walked into the t@@ ent."
And we will have at least two like that.
"In@@ ter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly, I asked this question when I was a little ki@@ d."
(Laughter) (Applause) Mo@@ m laughed hy@@ ster@@ ically at this one.
"Well, the subject of difficult ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle E@@ ast, of a man who left to his three son@@ s, 17 cam@@ el@@ s."
"But this wasn't quite right ei@@ ther, so in hon@@ or of it being discovered by a tel@@ escop@@ e in Hawai@@ i, we cons@@ ul@@ ted two exper@@ ts on Hawai@@ ian culture -- a Hawai@@ ian n@@ av@@ ig@@ ator and a l@@ ingu@@ ist -- to pro@@ pose a nam@@ e."
"W@@ her@@ e@@ as some people seek safe@@ ty with their famili@@ es, others attemp@@ t pas@@ sage alone and leave their loved ones behind with the hop@@ es of being re@@ un@@ ited lat@@ er."
"Wh@@ ile I was p@@ onder@@ ing this question, I came across this urban le@@ gend about Er@@ n@@ est Hem@@ ing@@ way, who alle@@ ge@@ dly said that these six words her@@ e: ""@@ F@@ or sal@@ e: baby sho@@ es, never wor@@ n@@ ,"" were the best novel he had ever writ@@ ten."
Don't ass@@ ume the natural choice is your sp@@ ouse or chil@@ d.
Every pro@@ vin@@ ce had its own market for agri@@ culture.
"I'm like, ""@@ Loo@@ ked at that. Be@@ en there."
"If you follow alon@@ g@@ : ""@@ F@@ or the time bein@@ g, I love you lo@@ ts, because you positively bring out all the best in me, and I laugh out lou@@ d, in other words, let's me know what's up."
"Even once the true cause of my disease is discover@@ ed, if we don't change our institu@@ tions and our culture, we will do this again to another disea@@ se."
What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of inter@@ fac@@ es you can build on top of it.
"It's not sustain@@ able, it's not health@@ y."
It's the prec@@ ise amount of har@@ m that comes to media companies whenever a single cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted song or movie gets p@@ ir@@ ated.
China still has large areas of under@@ development and per capit@@ a income is a better measure of the s@@ op@@ his@@ tic@@ ation of the econom@@ y.
"(Applause) And like the Gener@@ al A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ y, obviously the most wonder@@ ful, wonderful moment."
"@@ Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness, but rather a story of vic@@ tor@@ y and tri@@ um@@ ph@@ , of a v@@ ali@@ ant bat@@ tle and, event@@ u@@ ally, a gra@@ ce@@ ful re@@ tre@@ at, a story that ac@@ knowled@@ ges that not even the greatest general de@@ fe@@ ats every fo@@ e, that no doctor has ever su@@ c@@ ce@@ e@@ ded in making anyone imm@@ ort@@ al, and that no wi@@ fe, no matter how hard she tri@@ ed, has ever stopped even the bra@@ ves@@ t, wit@@ ti@@ est and most ma@@ d@@ den@@ ingly lo@@ v@@ able hus@@ band from d@@ ying when it was his time to go."
You have to imagine everybody I've ever cor@@ respon@@ ded with@@ .
"You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak ri@@ ce h@@ ull or peak cott@@ on@@ se@@ ed h@@ ull@@ s, because you have multiple cho@@ ic@@ es."
[@@ The Wa@@ y We Work@@ ] There's three billion working people in the world.
"The first is sort of the rest@@ or@@ ation ide@@ a, and it's somewhat intui@@ tiv@@ e."
"What we then need is to study the fundamental laws go@@ ver@@ ning conscious@@ ness, the laws that connect conscious@@ ness to other fundament@@ al@@ s: space, time, mas@@ s, physical process@@ es."

"So, I think you're dealing with something that people inst@@ inc@@ tiv@@ ely see as part of their moral sen@@ se."
"I use@@ , now, a whole new proc@@ ess."
But stress is so much more.
"This whole idea of a city not being a picture is, I think, something that art, in a sense, always was working with@@ ."
"But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any auth@@ ority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they wan@@ t."
You can play around with it.
"M@@ at@@ eri@@ als would be defin@@ ed as either techn@@ ical or biolog@@ ic@@ al, waste would be designed out enti@@ rel@@ y, and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long ter@@ m."
"C@@ old and fl@@ u have a huge bur@@ den on our socie@@ ties and on our own lives, but we don't really even take the most ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary pre@@ cau@@ tions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and fl@@ u during cold and fl@@ u seas@@ on."
But could you go a little fur@@ ther@@ ?
"When a kid beha@@ ves like I di@@ d, they don't exactly have to come out, right?"
"The average home power dri@@ ll is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes in its entire life@@ time, dep@@ ending on who you as@@ k."
And this is just a si@@ lic@@ on piece of skin.
E@@ stra@@ g@@ on@@ : Good idea.
"And the total month@@ ly cost for our band@@ wid@@ th is about 5,000 dollar@@ s."
It's about looking at the whole of one's time and seeing where the good stuff can go.
"That also means you're probably going to end up with an ear@@ ful of pain@@ t, because I need to paint your ear on your ear@@ ."
"And most of the time, the cells taste OK@@ ."
"But this is not a self-@@ ag@@ gran@@ di@@ zing enter@@ pris@@ e, because in this type of disco@@ very research, if you don't feel like a complete i@@ dio@@ t most of the time, you're just not sci@@ enc@@ ing hard enough@@ ."

Un@@ til I made a car@@ to@@ on about 9@@ /@@ 11.
"We did that by putting these artificial sp@@ ines on cra@@ b@@ s, as you see here, and then we tes@@ ted them."
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do@@ ; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
We see it in adver@@ tis@@ em@@ ents.
"It was a group called the New H@@ amp@@ sh@@ ire Re@@ bel@@ li@@ on that was beginning to talk about, how would we make this issue of this cor@@ rup@@ tion central in 201@@ 6@@ ?"
You think that's big.
So we did an experim@@ ent.
Why should you make wor@@ d@@ s?
"In appear@@ ance, he res@@ em@@ bled Ma@@ hat@@ ma Gand@@ hi@@ , min@@ us the lo@@ in@@ clo@@ th, plus or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c boo@@ ts."
But they were ran@@ dom things.
And they're te@@ aring up all the streets.
"You wouldn't want to let us run the ci@@ ties, go out and design them."
And what has happen@@ ed@@ ?
But there was ones in the literature.
And always low on past@@ -@@ negative and present@@ -@@ f@@ at@@ alism@@ .
"But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself@@ ."
"So I got about 10 cre@@ dit car@@ ds and lo@@ ans and got myself very close to bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ c@@ y, really, and bought myself this huge prin@@ ting pres@@ s, which I had no idea how to use at all."
S@@ ame de@@ al. You@@ : we're tim@@ ing for nor@@ ms.
"So when you look at something, like this image of this bab@@ y's fac@@ e, it goes into your eye and it lands on your retin@@ a, on the fron@@ t-@@ end cells here, the photo@@ rec@@ ep@@ tor@@ s."
"In certain communi@@ ties, we actually had to go as far as saying the Intern@@ ational Hum@@ an Righ@@ ts De@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation, which you op@@ posed because it wasn't written by religious sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s, well, those same princi@@ ples are in our boo@@ k."
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future.
"Th@@ ink about it@@ : 1@@ 1.@@ 5 million document@@ s, conta@@ ining the secre@@ ts of people from more than 200 different countri@@ es."
I call them the Che@@ e@@ ta@@ h Gener@@ ation.
(Laughter) What would you like for me to talk ab@@ out@@ ?
"A@@ ctu@@ ally, I realized I had read about the psycholog@@ y of poverty before."
And I got joy out of just watching them sleep.
"And thir@@ d, our bodies are fil@@ ters and sto@@ re@@ hou@@ ses for environmental tox@@ in@@ s."
A@@ bed would hug me. A@@ bed would sp@@ it at me.
"You could say it's ball@@ s@@ y, I gu@@ ess."
She did become a fin@@ ali@@ st@@ ; she brought Mar@@ sh@@ a to New York.
"The question is, who will make them@@ ?"
"So I went back to the store and said to the ow@@ ner, ""I love the sho@@ es, but I hate the l@@ ac@@ es."""
"He makes an addi@@ tional indi@@ ct@@ ment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us, these strong ties in our lives, actually have a hom@@ o@@ gen@@ izing effect on us."
"And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end, you'll see what the val@@ ley used to look like."
"Now, some of you may not recognize the sc@@ ene that's up here."
"Also, though we designed it a few years ago -- it's just become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in the last year or so -- this H@@ ear@@ t@@ stream de@@ f@@ ib@@ rill@@ ator which is saving lives."
I didn't feel emp@@ ty@@ ; I felt everything simul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously.
And it might sound impossible or na@@ i@@ ve to imagine that you could ever take that no@@ tion outside the high school au@@ dit@@ ori@@ um.
"F@@ our years ago here at TED@@ , Ra@@ y Kur@@ zwe@@ il and I started a new univers@@ ity called Sing@@ ular@@ ity Univers@@ ity."
(Applause) There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your atten@@ tion.
"And New@@ ton@@ 's Th@@ ir@@ d La@@ w stat@@ es that for every ac@@ tion, there is an equal and opposite reac@@ tion."
What does this mean@@ ?
"But the year D@@ onn@@ a changed the men@@ us, the Be@@ ars not only won their di@@ visi@@ on, they went on to win the state ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on@@ shi@@ p, be@@ ating the P@@ each Coun@@ ty Tro@@ j@@ ans 2@@ 8@@ -@@ 14@@ ."
"In my own life, I sh@@ all always be grateful for having found a form of play in my ir@@ ra@@ tional love of base@@ ball@@ ."
"So I was thinking, but when you look at the pa@@ st, the way to understand the past is only by the tra@@ ces avail@@ able, because we cannot go back [@@ to@@ ] the pa@@ st."
"So open primar@@ ies would make that problem much, much less sever@@ e."
"And as you think of that, what it means is potenti@@ ally you can re@@ build a full cop@@ y of any organis@@ m out of any one of its cell@@ s."
"(Laughter) F@@ or us human@@ s, who are ear@@ th@@ bo@@ und, birds represent freed@@ om@@ ."
"And whatever the short@@ -@@ run price for taking action on climate change or on secur@@ ity, or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education, these are pri@@ ces that are worth paying so that you build a stron@@ ger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stron@@ ger links between different countri@@ es."
"The better the technology get@@ s, the less reliable the dri@@ ver is going to ge@@ t."
"Well, over the past deca@@ de, we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequ@@ ences to off@@ ering people more and more cho@@ ic@@ es."
"As soon as they tell you their new name and p@@ ron@@ o@@ uns, that's when you start using them."
"When I saw that, I made a promise to myself@@ ."
"The story is about where you're arri@@ v@@ ing, or thinking about where you're arri@@ v@@ ing."
I've been to Tas@@ mani@@ a.
"But I think his son will understand this, and will have no sense of gru@@ d@@ ge, or sense of being ne@@ gle@@ c@@ ted, I thin@@ k."
Let's start from this moment.
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a cour@@ ty@@ ard th@@ en.
"People who support me and all other tr@@ ans people who@@ le@@ hear@@ te@@ dly are often so scar@@ ed to say to wrong thing, so em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sed to not know what they think they shoul@@ d, that they never as@@ k."
"Some time ago, I cap@@ tu@@ red several ways of sound to hit side w@@ all@@ s."
"The way you measure n@@ ano@@ technology is in n@@ an@@ ome@@ ters, and one n@@ an@@ ometer is a billi@@ on@@ th of a me@@ ter, and to put some scale to that, if you had a n@@ an@@ op@@ article that was one n@@ an@@ ometer th@@ ick@@ , and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the wid@@ th of a human hair@@ ."
(Laughter) But the up@@ side for middle bor@@ ns is that they also tend to develop den@@ ser and rich@@ er relationships outside the home.
We're going to have this un@@ limited number of worl@@ ds you can explore here.
"So, ye@@ ah@@ ."
The trans@@ ist@@ or was a small plastic un@@ it that would take us from a world of st@@ ati@@ c bri@@ cks pi@@ led on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active.
"E@@ ach incre@@ ment gets a seri@@ al number and a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate, and then the bre@@ wers and others buy those cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates as a way to return water to these de@@ gra@@ ded eco@@ system@@ s."
Because I found out -- we had a number of years at U@@ C@@ L@@ A where we didn't lose a game.
Why bo@@ ther@@ ?
"A few years later, I was at my next research job at Geor@@ gi@@ a Te@@ ch in At@@ lan@@ ta@@ , and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musici@@ an@@ s."
So this whole project was an experim@@ ent.
They are women and men who are prepar@@ ing themselves not for the comfortable predict@@ ability of yesterday but also for the reali@@ ties of today and all of those un@@ known possibilities of tomorrow.
So I sc@@ rap@@ ed it off.
"And I spoke to other exper@@ ts, and they said the p@@ in@@ stri@@ pe su@@ it -- classic psych@@ op@@ ath -- speak@@ s to it@@ ems one and two on the che@@ ck@@ list@@ : gli@@ b@@ ness, super@@ ficial char@@ m and gran@@ dio@@ se sense of self-@@ wor@@ th."
"This is a very serious research, that you should read the under@@ lin@@ e."
H@@ at@@ ers g@@ onn@@ a ha@@ te.
"He said, ""You don't say@@ !"""
"In her es@@ say, ""The Wh@@ ite Al@@ bum@@ ,"" Jo@@ an Di@@ di@@ on writ@@ es, ""We tell ourselves stories in order to liv@@ e."
A ban@@ ana pe@@ el on the tar@@ ma@@ c.
"I'm in this for the long run@@ , and I would be great@@ ly hon@@ ored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me."
"The image is terri@@ f@@ y@@ ing, but you quickly come to understand it's not re@@ al."
So you take this enc@@ ry@@ p@@ ted vo@@ te home as your recei@@ p@@ t.
"They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertain@@ ment, yet their courage and talent brought them through@@ ."
"So while we humans have made great progress in our rel@@ ent@@ less pursu@@ it of spe@@ ed, it turns out that nature was there fir@@ st."
"Well, we've seen good results so far@@ ."
As wa@@ ges increase that also li@@ f@@ ts the bur@@ den on the poor and the working class.
"We know that kids spend a lot of time behind scre@@ ens today, whether it's television or computer games or what@@ no@@ t."
"When you're awa@@ ke, you know you're awa@@ ke."
"And there he is, with this hor@@ ri@@ ble electri@@ cal box on his rum@@ p in this fantas@@ tic, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it pal@@ ac@@ e."
But perhaps the most challeng@@ ing part was to con@@ vin@@ ce the regul@@ ators -- a matter which was deb@@ ated in the par@@ li@@ am@@ ent -- that a young female surge@@ on be allowed the opportunity to pi@@ one@@ er for her country.
"And beyond the w@@ alls of our l@@ ab, we're even beginning to see sign@@ s of change in socie@@ ty."
We can also en@@ vision a romantic use of the genom@@ e.
"That these clo@@ g@@ ged ar@@ ter@@ ies that you see on the upp@@ er left, after only a year become meas@@ ura@@ bly less clo@@ g@@ ge@@ d."
Tr@@ ue stor@@ y: I was going to wir@@ e some money.
"I call this ""@@ victim@@ iz@@ ation of the victim@@ ."""
"(Applause) Now, I'm an art@@ ist."
"And I do think that in a few years, people will be comfortable getting by themselves in a self-@@ pi@@ lo@@ ted, electri@@ c@@ , V@@ T@@ O@@ L air ta@@ xi@@ ."
There's a lot of ways to do this with data@@ .
"We had to take them out, which we did."
I was a foreign cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Middle East rep@@ orting for A@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws.
H@@ mm ...
"We need mathema@@ tici@@ ans to come in and simul@@ ate this, to do Mon@@ te Car@@ l@@ o things to understand how these tools com@@ bine and work together."
"It's the only thre@@ at, the only influence that the re@@ e@@ f had to deal with@@ ."
The maj@@ ority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English@@ .
"T@@ wo@@ -S@@ i@@ x, this is T@@ wo@@ -S@@ i@@ x, we're mo@@ bi@@ le."
Thank you.
And we do know from other studies that this is a highly tox@@ ic mix@@ ture.
"I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world."
N@@ um@@ ber thre@@ e: Take a good look at what's inside your own suit@@ case and why you put it there.

And that's the answer@@ .
"So, I said, ""@@ Yeah, ye@@ ah, age of reason. What does that mean again@@ ?"""
"We had Air@@ Dy@@ nam@@ is@@ is, who, like I, did not want to work for a@@ ero@@ space companies on some big, many year project, and so we did our small proje@@ cts, and the company slowly gre@@ w."

"Le@@ t me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now, at least in this country."
"OK, in the negative time I have left, I'll tell you about the most recent -- (Laughter) inven@@ tion from our lab@@ ."
And my personal favorite was a sugges@@ tion by a blo@@ g@@ ger to have an e@@ je@@ ct but@@ ton in the car that you pres@@ s -- (Laughter) just before the car self-@@ destru@@ cts.
"Well, the fact of the matter is, look at this person in 195@@ 6, and this is when tex@@ ting doesn't ex@@ ist, ""I Love Lu@@ cy@@ "" is still on the air@@ ."

"You see some people did beautiful sti@@ pp@@ le ren@@ der@@ ings, like this one on top -- spent a long time making reali@@ stic ver@@ sion@@ s."

I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful co@@ w.
You see the sk@@ at@@ ers often tri@@ ck in this dire@@ ction. The ob@@ stac@@ les are easier.
"So among them, I have been a she@@ pher@@ des@@ s, a tru@@ ck dri@@ ver, a factor@@ y work@@ er, a clean@@ ing lad@@ y."
And often we op@@ t to just not go to the bath@@ room at all.
My biggest challenge is your blo@@ cks to accept these victim@@ s as our ow@@ n.

"I belie@@ ve, number one, it's com@@ plac@@ enc@@ y."
"And this makes sense, of course, right?"
(Laughter) All right.
"I think you all must be aware of it, but I'll still list it for the few who don@@ '@@ t."
"And then we get the extre@@ mes@@ : the far right, the far left, the extreme religious and the extreme anti@@ -@@ religi@@ ous, the far right dream@@ ing of a gol@@ den age that never was, the far left dream@@ ing of a ut@@ op@@ ia that never will be and the religious and anti@@ -@@ religious equally convinced that all it takes is God or the ab@@ s@@ ence of God to save us from oursel@@ ves."
"It's the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of poli@@ tici@@ ans deb@@ ating a new law by imag@@ ining what effect it might have, like when R@@ on@@ ald Reg@@ an war@@ ned that the introduc@@ tion of Medi@@ care would lead to a soci@@ ali@@ st future spent telling our children and our childr@@ en's children what it once was like in America when men were fre@@ e."
"And that was, ""How did this happen to me@@ ?"""
"In times of fe@@ ar, for instance, one of the things Ser@@ gi@@ o used to say is, fear is a bad advis@@ or."
"@@ Medi@@ a, the media landscape that we k@@ new@@ , as familiar as it was, as easy concep@@ tu@@ ally as it was to deal with the idea that profession@@ als bro@@ ad@@ cast mess@@ ages to am@@ ate@@ ur@@ s, is increas@@ ingly sli@@ pping away."

"N@@ ex@@ t, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teach@@ ers."
Music is something that lives inside of you.
And it's very much an in-@@ the-@@ moment activity that they're enga@@ ged in.
"Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying, I don't run a c@@ able compan@@ y, I don't run an invest@@ ment fir@@ m, I am not a da@@ ir@@ y farmer@@ ."
"So we thought, ""H@@ mm ... a peti@@ tion with one million sig@@ natur@@ es."
So let me show you an example of something that was transl@@ ated with a mach@@ ine.
"(Laughter) And wouldn't it be great to think that all we had to do to have happ@@ y, successful children was to talk to them, be interested in their future, put them to bed on time, and give them a book to read@@ ?"
"There were 8@@ ,000 kinds of no@@ tes in Americ@@ a."
I can see it in their eyes.
"I don't really need it because I've been doing this st@@ unt for audi@@ ences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years, taking f@@ at@@ al do@@ ses of home@@ opath@@ ic sleeping pill@@ s."
And so these are the sorts of extra@@ pol@@ ations that we have of what sort of loss we've had rel@@ ative to pre-@@ human impac@@ ts on the ocean.
That's the name of that bir@@ d.
"@@ Far@@ , far away from shi@@ pping lan@@ es and fishing fle@@ ets, di@@ ving into these wat@@ ers is a po@@ ign@@ ant remin@@ der of what our oce@@ ans once looked like."

"M@@ any years later, I had come to recognize that the problem that E@@ mm@@ a was fac@@ ing was a fra@@ ming problem."

"And so I'd go down to Green@@ wi@@ ch V@@ il@@ lage and I'd look for this hill@@ , and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that pal@@ m tre@@ e."
But now ...
"I know the free market fundament@@ ali@@ sts will tell you that more grow@@ th, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do."
I wor@@ e these already for five years until I moved out of that town.
"Because the business model for all these business@@ es requires that something be so simple we can use it oursel@@ ves, with little or no train@@ ing."
"So, si@@ r@@ , can you help me@@ ? I need help@@ ."
So it's really not even about urban versus r@@ ur@@ al.

"And if you look at cultures around the world, all you have to do is understand the myth@@ ology and you will see how they be@@ have and how they do busin@@ ess."
"And here, the idea is not that my we@@ ight gain is caus@@ ing your we@@ ight gain, n@@ or that I prefer@@ enti@@ ally form a tie with you because you and I share the same body si@@ ze, but rather that we share a common ex@@ po@@ sure to something, like a health club that makes us both lose we@@ ight at the same time."
"And, in fact, the ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er was essentially d@@ ele@@ ted by this thing."
"And it seemed to me looking at that -- that to@@ wer burning and then fall@@ ing, those to@@ wers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons here was that dens@@ ity kill@@ s."
"It means ""@@ to bring for@@ th what is with@@ in, to bring out potenti@@ al@@ ."""

We all knew that.
"In a mar@@ ti@@ al art, you would practice the white b@@ elt skills as long as necess@@ ary, and only when you've master@@ ed it you would move on to become a yellow bel@@ t."
"Well, my biggest ta@@ ke@@ away is that for dec@@ ad@@ es, we've been focused on political corre@@ ct@@ ness, but what matters more is emotional corre@@ ct@@ ness."
"So now I'm a phi@@ losop@@ her, and I study hard cho@@ ic@@ es, and I can tell you, that fear of the un@@ know@@ n, while a common motiv@@ ational de@@ faul@@ t in dealing with hard cho@@ ic@@ es, res@@ ts on a mis@@ concep@@ tion of them."

"One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times invest@@ ors would ask this question -- ""What is a scal@@ able model@@ ?"" -- as if the need of a community, which is only loc@@ ated in a space and time and has those needs only loc@@ ated in those plac@@ es, has no le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scal@@ e."

"Now, before descri@@ bing them, I need to add a ca@@ ve@@ at."
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.
"If you talk to them, and you said, ""What is your social life like@@ ?"""
It's such a deli@@ ght to have you on the sta@@ ge.

"The year after it was finished in 200@@ 4, you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four month@@ s."
"(Laughter) So, the most beautiful thing I found -- at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart val@@ ve."

I@@ v@@ an always had a passion for water.
This is used in conven@@ tional games as well.

"We have two bein@@ gs, both con@@ cei@@ ved in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day."
"So we started using sub@@ mar@@ in@@ es, and we equi@@ pped them with special blue lights on the front here."
And we then wanted to see whether we can mat@@ ch our anc@@ es@@ tra@@ l ma@@ ps with digital ma@@ ps made somewhere in the world.
"Well, I became a tap@@ es@@ try histor@@ i@@ an."
"(Applause) Thank you, thank you."
"(Laughter) Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something, and I'm thinking, this man is the Ty@@ pho@@ id Mar@@ y of ideas worth spread@@ ing, and I have infe@@ cted him."
"It brings that charac@@ ter inside of your personal space, a space that we'd usually res@@ er@@ ve for the people that we lo@@ ve."
"So in other words, I defin@@ e what I wan@@ ted."
And this isn't just found in pack@@ ag@@ ing.
Sal@@ a@@ am ala@@ ik@@ um.
This is just one examp@@ le.
"And he says, do you notice any@@ thing@@ ? And the water is wh@@ oo@@ sh@@ ing down this pi@@ pe."

"The reality is that even in democra@@ tic socie@@ ties today, we do not have good ans@@ wers for how you balance the need for security and law en@@ for@@ c@@ ement on one hand and protection of civi@@ l liber@@ ties and free speech on the other in our digital net@@ work@@ s."

"The small@@ est bran@@ ch of the hair@@ s looks like sp@@ at@@ ul@@ a@@ e, and an animal like that has one billion of these n@@ an@@ o-@@ size sp@@ lit end@@ s, to get very close to the sur@@ face.

"The other is power diff@@ usi@@ on, the way power is moving from all stat@@ es West or East to non-@@ state actor@@ s."
"And we have a very vi@@ br@@ ant network in China, partic@@ ular@@ ly, but also em@@ erg@@ ing in Braz@@ il and other parts of the world."

"The more you do of something, dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately the better you ge@@ t."
"So as you can probably t@@ ell, one of the defin@@ ing aspe@@ cts of pris@@ on life is ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity."
"It was not working with the comm@@ ander@@ s, the people that are more difficult to re@@ place, because you can easily rec@@ ru@@ it but you can't get the older comm@@ ander@@ s."
So it's the deep@@ est ge@@ ological bor@@ e hol@@ e ever dri@@ l@@ led.
"OK, now our initi@@ al curi@@ os@@ ity became infe@@ c@@ ti@@ ous."
And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this.
It is ourselves we are healing.
It is about a country in the sou@@ th@@ west of Africa called Nam@@ i@@ bi@@ a.
It's also obje@@ ction@@ able on a second ground.
"Now what you can see is we've sam@@ p@@ led the area in the North At@@ lan@@ tic, in the North Se@@ a in partic@@ ular@@ , and also the e@@ ast co@@ ast of North America fair@@ ly well."
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique character@@ is@@ tics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produc@@ es in their life@@ time@@ ?
These are vol@@ can@@ ic st@@ ones la@@ id by hand.

And my mind was now su@@ sp@@ ended between two very opposite plan@@ es of reality.
"And of course, looking at this li@@ on pa@@ w that has been sk@@ in@@ ne@@ d, it e@@ er@@ ily reminds me of a human hand, and that's iron@@ ic, because their f@@ ate is in our hand@@ s."
"And if that happen@@ s, if our gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s mel@@ t, ris@@ ing sea levels could well d@@ row@@ n the Mal@@ di@@ ves."

"Fin@@ ally, older people in traditional socie@@ ties have a huge signific@@ ance that would never occ@@ ur to us in our moder@@ n, liter@@ ate socie@@ ties, where our s@@ ources of information are books and the Inter@@ net."
We also associ@@ ate it with being stres@@ s-@@ free and on holi@@ day.

But I agre@@ ed to come and say a few things about this.

"So, you can play a video gam@@ e, drive through a piece of music, use your body ges@@ ture to control huge ma@@ ss@@ es of so@@ und, touch a special surface to make mel@@ o@@ dies, use your voice to make a whole au@@ ra@@ ."
E@@ ts@@ y is provi@@ ding goo@@ ds that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marke@@ t@@ place.

Why do we want to protect your home@@ ?
"Not because they had found some final peace or tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ence, but because they were so re@@ pul@@ sed by what their lives had become -- in a wor@@ d, cut off, or u@@ gl@@ y."
So that's an incredible thing.

This is a picture that shows the tail of a right wh@@ al@@ e.
"E@@ L@@ A@@ M@@ 's gradu@@ ates, some from right here in D@@ .@@ C@@ . and Bal@@ ti@@ more, have come from the poor@@ est of the poor to offer health, education and a voice to their communi@@ ties."
"We see these ideas again and again in the medi@@ a, in public health poli@@ c@@ y, doct@@ or@@ s' offic@@ es, in everyday conversations and in our own attitu@@ des."
"And these guys are, like, seri@@ al offen@@ ders, and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator@@ ."
"I thought I couldn't believe in St@@ or@@ y@@ Cor@@ ps any more deeply than I di@@ d, but it was at that moment that I fully and vis@@ cer@@ ally gra@@ sp@@ ed the importance of making these recor@@ ding@@ s."
""@@ "E@@ dit@@ "" was formed from ""@@ edit@@ or@@ ."""
That's normal@@ .
"One is to deliver ex@@ trin@@ si@@ c motiv@@ ation, that education has a pay@@ off."
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.
"As a matter of fact, we ne@@ gle@@ cted the in@@ for@@ mal and the traditional sect@@ ors."
"It chan@@ ges, and it mor@@ ph@@ s in response to stim@@ u@@ li@@ ."
"D@@ uring that perio@@ d, we'll likely spend a lot of time in hospit@@ als and hosp@@ ices and care hom@@ es."
"When researchers ask hero@@ in addi@@ cts what's the tou@@ gh@@ est drug to qu@@ it, most say c@@ igar@@ ett@@ es."
"F@@ i@@ ve is blu@@ e, seven is yel@@ low@@ , eight is char@@ tre@@ use@@ , nine is indi@@ go, OK?"
And the whole room filled with smo@@ ke in about two secon@@ ds.
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Face@@ book.
"She has a c@@ ab@@ ine@@ t, a min@@ ister of education, a min@@ ister for energy, a min@@ ister for health@@ ."
"He also establi@@ shed trade with many foreign n@@ ations, including Great Brita@@ in and the United Stat@@ es, and ple@@ d@@ ged non-@@ inter@@ ference with their foreign poli@@ ci@@ es."
"We want a world where life is preser@@ ved and the quality of life is enrich@@ ed for every@@ body, not only for the privile@@ ge@@ d."
"So I spent the next two years inter@@ vie@@ wing conv@@ ic@@ ted terror@@ ists, j@@ i@@ ha@@ d@@ is and for@@ mer extre@@ m@@ ist@@ s."
"I started taking a look as well at different per@@ i@@ me@@ ters, because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data@@ ."
"This is in 13 hospit@@ als in four countries, and since 20@@ 10, we've done well over 2,000 surger@@ ies with no clin@@ ically ad@@ verse event@@ s."
"It's now in many ci@@ ties, half the price of a ta@@ xi@@ ."
"By that I mean, ask yourself the question: ""Wh@@ o does this idea bene@@ fit@@ ?"""
And there's a simple princi@@ ple of strategy that say@@ s: Do un@@ to yourself before others do un@@ to you.
"So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother, and as we're going across the oce@@ an, following these rul@@ es, she reali@@ zes that she's rolling pretty high@@ , and she says to me, ""@@ We're not going to make it."""
So why does this mat@@ ter@@ ?
And we cannot have all the answer@@ s.
"But the cool thing is that, if you look in the em@@ br@@ y@@ o, as the em@@ br@@ y@@ o is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x hand@@ ."
"We can use technology for transpar@@ enc@@ y, and many other things."
Aut@@ onom@@ y: the ur@@ ge to direct our own lives.
They're just not mov@@ ing.
"And she's slightly dre@@ ading it, and she's a bit con@@ fu@@ sed because despite her mom telling her all the time that she's beautiful@@ , every day at school, someone tells her that she's u@@ gl@@ y."
"In Brita@@ in, we have a particularly v@@ ici@@ ous se@@ ction of the righ@@ t-@@ wing pres@@ s, and they went nut@@ s."
"There are over 20 p@@ ages of re@@ views of his work descri@@ bing him as super@@ -@@ friendly and fa@@ st, and he's reached level 2@@ 5, the highest level, making him a Super@@ R@@ ab@@ b@@ it."
And that's exactly what the beet@@ les are doing here.
That's walking Ab@@ ra@@ ham@@ 's P@@ ath@@ .
And so I ended up walking like this.
It's a r@@ are condi@@ tion.
"It was Cam@@ us who once said that, ""@@ Man is the only species who re@@ f@@ uses to be what he really is@@ ."""
"Because there are some advan@@ ta@@ ges to in@@ organ@@ ic systems, like higher speed se@@ mic@@ on@@ du@@ ct@@ ors, etc."
The second one is intern@@ al energy.
That's kind of ridi@@ cul@@ ous. It's a total de@@ co@@ y.
"Well when the da@@ f-@@ 2 rec@@ ep@@ tor is activ@@ e, then it trig@@ gers a series of events that prevent F@@ O@@ X@@ O from getting into the nu@@ cle@@ us where the DNA is."
They know her. They recognize the research bo@@ at.
"W@@ hy@@ ? Because batter@@ ies life cycle improve -- a bit of improvem@@ ent on energy den@@ sit@@ y, which reduc@@ es the pri@@ ce."
"My a@@ un@@ t, an incredibly artic@@ ul@@ ate and brilli@@ ant wom@@ an, was wi@@ do@@ wed ear@@ ly."
So it doesn't really g@@ low.
"So whether it's for photography around cor@@ ner@@ s, or creating the next generation of health imag@@ ing, or creating new visu@@ aliz@@ ations, since our inven@@ tion, we have open-@@ s@@ ourc@@ ed all the data and detail@@ s on our websit@@ e, and our hope is that the DIY@@ , the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ els in camer@@ as -- (Laughter) and start foc@@ using on the next dimen@@ sion in imag@@ ing."
"I must tell you I am like that, not very comfort@@ able, because us@@ u@@ ally, in life, I think my job is absolutely us@@ el@@ ess."
"The S@@ t. Geor@@ ge@@ 's C@@ i@@ tiz@@ ens Coun@@ cil on I@@ l@@ legal Imm@@ ig@@ ration held reg@@ ular and active pro@@ tes@@ ts against imm@@ ig@@ ration, and so what I gle@@ an@@ ed from this Wh@@ it@@ op@@ ia is what a hot debate this would be@@ com@@ e."

"And so, this astro@@ la@@ be is on lo@@ an from us from the Ox@@ ford School of -- Museum of Histor@@ y."
"@@ Nat@@ ure, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way."
"You see, I was six when the Ta@@ li@@ b@@ an took over Afghanist@@ an and made it il@@ legal for girls to go to school@@ ."

"I gave my intro@@ , and I played the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish scen@@ e."
"Now will we let the G@@ ul@@ f Co@@ ast langu@@ ish for a dec@@ ade or two, like the South B@@ ron@@ x di@@ d?"
F@@ our@@ te@@ en billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.
Everyone is both a lear@@ ner and a teach@@ er.
So why might it be hard to fin@@ d?
We nearly went ex@@ tin@@ ct. We were hanging on by our fing@@ ern@@ ail@@ s.
(Laughter) But it would never have occur@@ red to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a charac@@ ter was a seri@@ al kill@@ er that he was somehow re@@ present@@ ative of all Americ@@ ans.
"For me that meant no read@@ ing, no writ@@ ing, no video gam@@ es, no work or ema@@ il, no run@@ n@@ ing, no alco@@ hol@@ , no caf@@ fein@@ e."
"But to understand all that, we actually have to back up and talk about why we get ma@@ d in the first place."
"So traditional reac@@ tors like a pressu@@ ri@@ zed water reac@@ tor or bo@@ iling water reac@@ tor@@ , they're very, very hot water at very high pres@@ sur@@ es, and this mean@@ s, essenti@@ ally, in the event of an acci@@ d@@ ent, if you had any kind of bre@@ ach of this stain@@ less ste@@ el pres@@ sure ves@@ sel@@ , the cool@@ ant would leave the co@@ re."
"(Laughter) ""@@ Your mother and I need some color@@ -@@ co@@ ding system so we don't get con@@ fu@@ se@@ d."""
And from those single points e@@ man@@ ated stories.
And so we have set about doing that.
B@@ F: Here we go.
""@@ "U@@ ktu@@ b@@ ,"" writ@@ e, in the im@@ per@@ ativ@@ e."
It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.
"This is no surpris@@ e, though, if you look at the in@@ sigh@@ ts of con@@ tempor@@ ary psycholog@@ y."
"The pattern repe@@ ats for each group of new particip@@ ants, with money from recent arri@@ v@@ als funn@@ el@@ ed to those who rec@@ ru@@ ited them."
It's showing Char@@ lie Cha@@ pl@@ in dealing with some of the major changes during the Industri@@ al Revolu@@ tion.
"You see, you can take out one or two hu@@ b tre@@ es, but there comes a ti@@ pping point, because hu@@ b trees are not un@@ like ri@@ v@@ ets in an airplan@@ e."
"W@@ her@@ e@@ as with Is@@ l@@ am as a maj@@ ority religion and Christi@@ an@@ ity, you see countries all the way."
Instagra@@ m gets its us@@ ers addi@@ cted to the powerful feeling of getting atten@@ tion.
"It is a very ag@@ gres@@ sive canc@@ er, in part because it's discovered at very late stag@@ es, when it's highly adv@@ anced and there are a number of genetic mut@@ ations."
"The pattern of this shape living in e@@ igh@@ t-@@ dimensional char@@ ge space is ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely beautiful@@ , and it sum@@ mar@@ iz@@ es thousands of possible interac@@ tions between these elem@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ les, each of which is just a fac@@ et of this complicated sha@@ pe."
"We go like that, and we imagine that's what de@@ af@@ ness is about."
"Th@@ rou@@ gh websit@@ es like Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e or man@@ aging your data on Micro@@ soft Heal@@ th@@ V@@ aul@@ t or Google Heal@@ th, le@@ ver@@ aging this together in partici@@ pat@@ ory ways will be increas@@ ingly important."
He was interested in productiv@@ ity -- I think it's something that conc@@ ern@@ s all of us -- but it's easy to measure in chick@@ ens because you just coun@@ t the eg@@ gs.
"And when people like L@@ an are sitting at the policy t@@ able, they can make a differ@@ ence."
Do@@ es anybody know@@ ?
"This is a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bo@@ w, with 4@@ 5@@ -@@ po@@ und draw weigh@@ ts."
So this has applic@@ ations in all walks of life.
"Even the re@@ lic@@ s of se@@ em@@ ingly happ@@ ier times are descri@@ bed as cru@@ ci@@ fying the auth@@ or@@ : “@@ My hus@@ band and child sm@@ iling out of the family photo@@ ; The@@ ir sm@@ il@@ es catch onto my sk@@ in, little sm@@ iling hoo@@ ks@@ .@@ ” H@@ er dom@@ es@@ tic dis@@ satisfac@@ tion and her hus@@ band@@ ’s m@@ ist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of her are constant them@@ es in her later poetr@@ y."
"So then he deci@@ des to head for the U@@ K, where his un@@ cle lives."
"How can we stay imm@@ une to that passi@@ on, that energy, that excit@@ em@@ ent@@ ?"
"I spend most of my wa@@ king hours trying to deter@@ mine how deep we can go into the Earth and still find something, any@@ thing, that's ali@@ ve, because we still don't know the answer to this very basic question about life on Ear@@ th."
"I was on my way out, and before I could make it to my car, two police cars pul@@ led up to blo@@ ck my ex@@ it, and an offic@@ er approach@@ ed me from be@@ hin@@ d."
That's why writing on the Internet has become a li@@ fes@@ a@@ ver for me.
So we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concent@@ rat@@ or.
"So inste@@ ad, I thought it would probably be a better idea if I went home and w@@ ro@@ te."
We ins@@ ist on faith in the future and in each other.
And the myster@@ y is to explain this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar num@@ ber.
"The good people in S@@ co@@ t@@ land are still improving my vo@@ ice, and I'm optimistic about it."
W@@ ould you explain the rules for ad@@ mis@@ sion@@ ?
"Now in the At@@ lan@@ tic, the story is pretty simp@@ le."
"In 17@@ 9@@ 6, Th@@ omas Je@@ ff@@ er@@ son received a box of b@@ ones he couldn't identi@@ f@@ y."
"(Laughter) I be@@ g to diff@@ er with Mar@@ k T@@ wa@@ in, though@@ ."
"This is an old bicycle tu@@ be, which gives you a bro@@ ad ru@@ b@@ ber b@@ and, two safe@@ ty p@@ in@@ s."
They ri@@ f@@ led through my back@@ pac@@ k.
"OK, this is a view taken on the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge itself@@ ."
"And then there is a third fil@@ ter, it's a biological fil@@ ter."
"A simple ac@@ t, in 198@@ 7, of the most famous woman in the world, the Pr@@ inc@@ ess of Wal@@ es, tou@@ ching an HIV@@ /@@ AIDS infe@@ cted baby did a great de@@ al, especially in Euro@@ pe, to stop that."
"So in re@@ invent@@ ing fi@@ re, we integr@@ ated all four sect@@ ors that use energy -- transport@@ ation, build@@ ings, industry and electri@@ city -- and we integr@@ ated four kinds of innov@@ ation, not just technology and poli@@ c@@ y, but also design and business strateg@@ y."
"Well, to love well and to work well, you need wis@@ dom@@ ."
"A@@ h, mm -- slightly differ@@ ent."
It actually changed ourselves.
"And if you think you have to get involved in something, even if it's an emer@@ gen@@ c@@ y, try finding an activ@@ ist group or an N@@ G@@ O@@ , and ob@@ tain the full support of the ac@@ a@@ demic community -- whatever that means -- before you get invol@@ ved."
We cannot transform Africa by ourselves.
He descri@@ bed this expe@@ di@@ tion as 10 times as dangerous as Ever@@ est.
"A@@ stronom@@ ically, we're calcul@@ ating posi@@ tions."
"But that actually doesn't mean at all that if we gave people more exp@@ ort@@ s, more tra@@ de, that that would increase pre@@ val@@ ence."
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adop@@ ted because it works.
"The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of co@@ her@@ ence to this, but not terri@@ bly success@@ ful@@ ly."
"But in order to do that, we are the ones that have to as@@ sign that valu@@ e; other@@ wis@@ e, it will be des@@ e@@ cr@@ ated by someone who doesn't understand that valu@@ e."
"It was invented by R@@ us@@ sell S@@ mi@@ th, a passionate invent@@ or in New Ze@@ al@@ and who was trying to help bl@@ ind people."
"The idea of a common reality is like, I sup@@ po@@ se, a lot of philosoph@@ ical concep@@ ts@@ : easy to state but mysteri@@ ously difficult to put into practic@@ e."
So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much ol@@ der.
(Laughter) Are you going to come and dra@@ g me off@@ ?
(Laughter) And I had no idea what she was talking ab@@ out.
What if we could do this in Fre@@ e@@ Spe@@ e@@ ch inste@@ ad@@ ?
But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infra@@ structure or the resourc@@ es.
"G@@ 7, other rich countries -- get your act together."
"So, we are at the stage where we don't really know how to comp@@ ute with these kinds of dev@@ ic@@ es."
Here's a question we need to re@@ think toge@@ ther@@ : What should be the role of money and markets in our socie@@ ti@@ es?
"But there is -- I mean, I'm going to have some help@@ , and the best person to help me intro@@ du@@ ce the code is actually the first man to sequ@@ ence it, Dr. Cra@@ ig V@@ enter@@ ."
"And you wouldn't believe how many people told me, ""O@@ h no, not a@@ ero@@ spac@@ e."
I was in my office some months back and got a tele@@ phone call@@ .
"Now, he's a rock clim@@ ber, but you know, he's our execu@@ tive dire@@ ct@@ or."
"It's because we -- if we look from far@@ , we see our line of evolu@@ tion."
"D@@ ue to the re@@ mov@@ al of his hi@@ p@@ po@@ camp@@ us, H@@ .@@ M@@ .@@ 's ability to form long-term memories was also dama@@ ge@@ d."
Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to la@@ bel as str@@ anger@@ s were actually friends waiting to be discover@@ ed.
"But I can read this ma@@ p, and what this map says is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red do@@ ts are, that's where people are, where the cities are, you're going to have to put the ser@@ vers where the blue do@@ ts are to do that most effectiv@@ el@@ y."
So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.
(Laughter) I decided that I was going to break the world record live on pri@@ me@@ -@@ time television.
"(Laughter) He also says that the cause of all our trou@@ ble is the belie@@ f in an essenti@@ al, pure identi@@ ty@@ : religi@@ ous, eth@@ nic@@ , histor@@ ic@@ al, ide@@ olog@@ ic@@ al."
"So, while I'm very excited about all we can do for cool@@ ing, and I think there's a lot yet to be done, as a scient@@ ist, I'm also dra@@ wn to a more pro@@ found opportunity that I believe this work high@@ ligh@@ ts."
And the pho@@ sp@@ h@@ or is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
"We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days, and what's happening really is that people are un@@ able quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and re@@ productive health serv@@ ices for sex work@@ ers, un@@ able quite to be giving out need@@ les to junk@@ ies."
"So it's really interest@@ ing, and it makes sense in a way, that they're still yo@@ ung, so why would they be getting diseas@@ es of aging until their ol@@ d?"
"Th@@ ir@@ d, a tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory is planned that carries the qu@@ ad from its current state to the impact point with the ball@@ ."
"So when I also think about desig@@ n, I think about trying to re@@ work and re-@@ engage the lines on this gra@@ ph in a more productive way."
Ch@@ ant@@ ing: One un@@ ited n@@ ation.
And I'm really here to talk about design.
Some people turn into ro@@ ck@@ ers like this.
We humans are Earth@@ 's P@@ and@@ or@@ an speci@@ es.
"In case it's been a while since you've been sitting in a history clas@@ s, here is what the Secon@@ d Am@@ end@@ ment actually say@@ s: ""@@ A well regul@@ ated M@@ ili@@ ti@@ a, being necessary to the security of a free Stat@@ e, the right of the people to keep and be@@ ar ar@@ ms, sh@@ all not be inf@@ rin@@ ge@@ d."""
Children can use it. A@@ dul@@ ts can use it. Every@@ body uses it.
"I wanted to come up with something I hop@@ ed could make me a better teach@@ er, and give the yo@@ ung@@ sters under my super@@ visi@@ on, be it in athle@@ tics or the English class@@ room, something to which to a@@ spi@@ re, other than just a higher mark in the class@@ room, or more points in some athle@@ tic con@@ tes@@ t."
The o@@ ct@@ op@@ us left my hands and then did the da@@ m@@ ne@@ dest thing: It lan@@ ded on the bottom in the ru@@ b@@ ble and -- f@@ woo@@ sh@@ ! -- van@@ is@@ hed right before my eyes.
"So until then, even though a color might be all around them, they simply did not have the ability to see it."
