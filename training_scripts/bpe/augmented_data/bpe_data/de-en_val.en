But that will require helping these socie@@ ties transi@@ tion from having mer@@ ely political co@@ ali@@ tions to building genu@@ in@@ ely gra@@ ss@@ roo@@ ts@@ -@@ based social movem@@ ents that advocate for the democra@@ tic culture.

"When I came to this company one year ago, I thought to myself, this company has anti@@ -@@ discrimin@@ ation poli@@ cies that protect ga@@ y, les@@ bi@@ an, bis@@ ex@@ ual and trans@@ gender people."
"So we experim@@ ented with tiny atom@@ ized water partic@@ les to create a dr@@ y m@@ ist that is shap@@ ed by the wind and in test@@ ing, discovered that it can be shap@@ ed by people who can interact and move through it without getting we@@ t."
The aw@@ k@@ ward reality is we're not making fast enough progress.
And all of these bl@@ ank areas are the areas in which the wi@@ res are running through@@ .
I think it's times 100 or something like that.
I was devast@@ ated by this.
"I loved that I could hi@@ de within this sha@@ dow my own painted ver@@ sion, and it would be almost in@@ visible until the light change@@ d, and all of a sud@@ den my sha@@ dow would be brought to the light."
"E@@ vent@@ u@@ ally, you can sort of rough@@ ly see that there's sort of a diam@@ ond shape over@@ all, and when it's fully done, it@@ 'll look like a giant diam@@ on@@ d, or that's the idea behind it, and it's ali@@ g@@ ned on true nor@@ th."
Are you ready to go@@ ? OK.
"If you've had a friend who's died of AID@@ S, then you hate HIV@@ ."
Is it actually possi@@ ble@@ ?
"O@@ ther places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places and see what happened to their pre@@ val@@ enc@@ e?"
"M@@ ig@@ r@@ ating e@@ ast@@ war@@ d, following the gra@@ ss@@ land@@ s, because that's what they were adap@@ ted to live on."
It's really pure fl@@ ying.
"And while certain sign@@ s sp@@ an thousands of kil@@ ome@@ ters, other sign@@ s had much more res@@ tri@@ cted distribu@@ tion pattern@@ s, with some being limited to a single ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y, like we see here with these divi@@ ded re@@ ct@@ an@@ gles that are only found in nor@@ thern Spa@@ in, and which some researchers have spe@@ cul@@ ated could be some sort of family or cl@@ an sign@@ s."
"As a mag@@ ici@@ an, I try to create images that make people stop and thin@@ k."
It ga@@ ined cre@@ di@@ bility from both the Leb@@ an@@ ese and the international community.
And so what I decided to do.
""@@ "Just a one-@@ ey@@ ed mon@@ key@@ ,"" said the Bra@@ h@@ min@@ ."
They are just going alon@@ e@@ ! (Applause) And many times I get the impres@@ sion that they are not really even interested in hearing from African@@ s who might know.
We've heard a lot about that.
"(Laughter) ""I love how I feel today."""
"Because not many people are really going to read Ar@@ chi@@ me@@ des in ancient Gree@@ k, but they should have the chance to do it."
"This is Bir@@ h@@ an, who was the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian girl who laun@@ ched Live A@@ id in the 19@@ 80@@ s, 15 minutes away from death when she was res@@ cu@@ ed, and that picture of her being res@@ cu@@ ed is one that went round the world."
Evolution in Middle World has not equi@@ pped us to handle very im@@ prob@@ able event@@ s; we don't live long enough.
L@@ ater they really wanted to have the opportunity to wel@@ come me form@@ ally.
Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her brea@@ st@@ s.
So back to my original question.
"I@@ s there some kind of natural illu@@ stra@@ tion, some demon@@ stration that would gra@@ b people's imagin@@ ation her@@ e@@ ?"""
"So I think one of the reasons people are dist@@ ur@@ bed by destro@@ ying books, people don't want to ri@@ p books and nobody really wants to throw away a book, is that we think about books as living things, we think about them as a body, and they're created to rel@@ ate to our body, as far as scal@@ e, but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things."
"It's possible to start already now, it's just too danger@@ ous."
This is what it looks like under my des@@ k.
Here's a ba@@ y@@ on@@ et@@ te from the C@@ ivi@@ l War@@ .
One fact is not true.
It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identi@@ fi@@ er for the new social group that they've ha@@ d.
"A@@ re they positively cor@@ rel@@ ated, giving money makes you happ@@ y?"
"It en@@ ables you to see the world in a new way, through someone else@@ 's ey@@ es."
Je@@ e gets to have his proje@@ ct@@ ; the public gets a swee@@ ter environment@@ ; and different public gets a place to express itself@@ ; and the adver@@ tis@@ ers finally get somebody to look at their ad@@ s.
Those fol@@ ds fol@@ d into a ba@@ se. You shape the ba@@ se.
Ra@@ ise your hands.
"I moved back to New York, my work has change@@ d."
It's always rene@@ wing and refreshing itself.
"Because the sun@@ shine kid was brigh@@ t, with a warm person@@ alit@@ y, And inside he bur@@ ned sav@@ ag@@ ely H@@ ur@@ t by the words and cur@@ ses of the shadow@@ y fol@@ k who spoke hol@@ es in his soul and left ca@@ vi@@ ties, And as his heart har@@ den@@ ed, his spar@@ k dar@@ ken@@ ed, Every time they called him nam@@ es it coo@@ led his fl@@ am@@ es, He thought they might like him if he kept his light di@@ m But they were busy telling light@@ ning she had terrible a@@ im@@ , He coul@@ dn@@ ’t quite get to gri@@ ps with what they said, So he let his light be e@@ cli@@ p@@ sed by what they said, He fell into a L@@ one Star St@@ ate like Tex@@ as, And felt like he@@ ’@@ d been pun@@ ched in his solar plex@@ us."
And so the problem with having 9@@ 00 of something is that you have to do every step 9@@ 00 times.
"When I was 2@@ 2 years old, I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stor@@ ies."
"They probably aren't enough ei@@ ther, unless we help@@ ."

"Well, this is how I approach@@ ed it, this is what I did."
"But I was quickly told that, ""@@ Bo@@ y, our government doesn't really work like that@@ ."" (Laughter) Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a non@@ profit to kind of help cons@@ ul@@ t and get this idea going along with the government, but then I was tol@@ d, ""S@@ on, our government looks to private se@@ ctor for things like this@@ ."""
"Because of doct@@ or@@ -@@ patient privile@@ ge, they couldn't really tell us what was going on."
"But of course, that only works when we have both of these compon@@ ents."
"The other 90 percent take refu@@ ge in silence -- half of them, because the inci@@ dent invol@@ ves a close family member or someone they know, and that makes it much more difficult to deal with and talk about."
"In India, nobody really talks about works of art@@ ; they always talk about the appreci@@ ation of ar@@ t."
"When the Ges@@ tap@@ o sear@@ ched her on the tra@@ in, she gave them a cas@@ ual tour of her “@@ film proje@@ ct@@ or@@ .@@ ” When an offic@@ er spo@@ t@@ ted her hanging her a@@ eri@@ al, she chat@@ ted about her passion for listening to music on the radi@@ o@@ – and char@@ med him into helping her set up the c@@ able."
"This was the largest acqu@@ isi@@ tion in their history, they'd never made an acqu@@ isi@@ tion over a billi@@ on, and people as@@ ked, ""How did you know this@@ ?"""

(Applause) E@@ B: Am@@ anda is wearing our e@@ LE@@ G@@ S se@@ t.
"W@@ hat's driving it, and what can we do about it?"
So it was the spread of tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is and the spread of ch@@ ol@@ era that I was responsible for in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing.

"But it makes the point all the more, of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is."
Now I am afraid of people.

"For too long now, children with develop@@ mental disor@@ ders have suff@@ ered from mis@@ diagno@@ sis while their real problems have gone un@@ dete@@ cted and left to wor@@ sen."

"There is no way we can talk about a last@@ ing peac@@ e, building of democra@@ c@@ y, sustainable econom@@ ies, any kind of st@@ abili@@ ties, if we do not fully inclu@@ de women at the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating t@@ able."

So what we see is that this neur@@ on knows whenever the r@@ at has gone into one particular place in its environment.
"I want us to start by thinking about this dev@@ ice, the phone that's very likely in your po@@ ckets right now."

"My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way, and I'm one of many people who belie@@ ves that this focus on g@@ ad@@ get@@ s, on acc@@ ess@@ or@@ izing -- What can I add to my house, what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustain@@ able@@ ? -- has kind of domin@@ ated the discus@@ sion@@ ."

"So to help us reve@@ al people's fac@@ ial emo@@ tions, we have developed a new imag@@ ing technology we call ""@@ trans@@ der@@ mal op@@ tical imag@@ ing."""
Why com@@ ed@@ y?
"One of my colleagues in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ i@@ a, N@@ even@@ a Mar@@ ko@@ v@@ a, spent about 20 years studying these pro@@ fil@@ es."
"And their in@@ au@@ gu@@ ral ex@@ hi@@ bit was called ""@@ Happ@@ in@@ ess@@ ."""
"@@ Richard Ser@@ r@@ a let go of painting at that moment, but he didn't let go of art.

He did these things to all kinds of materi@@ al. He would take a huge she@@ et of lead and roll it up and un@@ roll it. He would do the same thing to ru@@ b@@ ber, and when he got to the dire@@ ction ""@@ to li@@ ft@@ ,"" he created this, which is in the Museum of Mo@@ dern Ar@@ t."
I actually got a photograph of the Ver@@ iz@@ on employe@@ e right there.
"Today, the trans@@ it, the Ma@@ in Street and the new hou@@ sing have all been buil@@ t."
There are billions of inter@@ connected neur@@ ons in an impossible tan@@ g@@ le.
"The ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowfla@@ ke on top of another snowfla@@ ke, year after year."
"So, I'd like to share our experience and what we've learned so far and hope@@ fully contribute two c@@ ents to this convers@@ ation."
"It may look like a tiny wor@@ m or a transpar@@ ent blo@@ b, and whenever you try to get a closer loo@@ k, it dis@@ appear@@ s, only to re@@ appear as soon as you shift your g@@ lan@@ ce."
And I began giving her my ra@@ p.
"So, in designing a city for the blin@@ d, I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more in@@ clusi@@ ve, a more equ@@ it@@ able, a more just city for all."
"And now, using a series of three camer@@ as, we can dete@@ ct if a dri@@ ver is looking forwar@@ d, looking away, looking down, on the ph@@ one, or having a cup of coffe@@ e."
I think I have it.
Good morning. How are you@@ ?
What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tack@@ le@@ ?
They were all holding their photo as a stat@@ em@@ ent.
"They would get dent@@ ur@@ es, and if you got dent@@ ur@@ es, you weren't going to be able to eat cor@@ n-@@ on-@@ the-@@ co@@ b, you weren't going to be able to eat ap@@ pl@@ es, you weren't going to be able to eat ste@@ ak@@ ."
And I know that TED ga@@ thers many creative min@@ ds.
"And you can see that, in a developing society that was beginning to acqu@@ ire language, not having language would be a like a bird without w@@ ing@@ s."
"And as others like him pursu@@ ed their own version of the American dream@@ , white flight became common in the South B@@ ron@@ x and in many cities around the country."
"S@@ ti@@ ll others sug@@ gest that maybe this is something that formed during the death thro@@ es of a star@@ , perhaps during a super@@ nov@@ a explo@@ sion, as planet@@ ary material got sh@@ red@@ de@@ d."
"And then we fle@@ w Al@@ an She@@ pher@@ d weeks after G@@ ag@@ ar@@ in, not months or dec@@ ad@@ es, or whate@@ ver. So we had the cap@@ abilit@@ y."
"(Laughter) And I'm like, ""You know, all the sign@@ s we keep seeing with the Chinese charac@@ ter on them@@ ."""
"G@@ row@@ ing up, he saw his parents work so hard as farmer@@ s, but bar@@ ely get b@@ y."
"We don't have a choice about heart@@ brea@@ k, we only have a choice of having our hear@@ ts broken over people and things and projects that we deeply care about."
They weren't mistak@@ es@@ ; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was em@@ bar@@ ra@@ s@@ sed by it.
"B@@ eing a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at, then and now, is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the stat@@ us of it."
C@@ loud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.
Do they go from one side of the P@@ aci@@ fic to the other@@ ?
"A world fit for mamm@@ als. F@@ rom tiny sh@@ re@@ ws [@@ cam@@ e@@ ] ten@@ rec@@ s, ac@@ custom@@ ed to the dar@@ k."
What do we know about other old strategi@@ es like this?
"And, of course, this is ner@@ d heav@@ en, right?"
I am sure my mother did not mean to dis@@ courage me.
"It ru@@ ined my life -- (Laughter) ""The In@@ conven@@ i@@ ent Tru@@ th@@ "" and Mr. Go@@ re."

"I wish I could talk about sweet words spo@@ ken or gifts that I received from this af@@ fair@@ , but I can@@ no@@ t."
"And to you, every@@ one, thank you very much."
But my daughter never com@@ pla@@ in@@ ed.
"I felt it very strongly during our little deli@@ ber@@ ations at V@@ ev@@ e@@ y, that when people of all different per@@ su@@ asi@@ ons come together, working side by side for a common go@@ al, differences melt away."

"So G@@ he@@ z, there we go. That's your new symme@@ tri@@ cal obje@@ ct."
(Laughter) Now I think the whole concept of a mer@@ ma@@ id doesn't really bl@@ end into the sw@@ am@@ p feel@@ .
They found European service provi@@ ders that still had 20@@ -year-old anal@@ og di@@ al-@@ up access infra@@ stru@@ cture.
"Un@@ like the low ent@@ rop@@ y of the early univer@@ se, even though we don't know the answer for this, we at least have a good theory that can explain it, if that theory is right, and that's the theory of dark energ@@ y."
"@@ Like le@@ gi@@ ons of other children, I came from an ab@@ usi@@ ve hou@@ seh@@ old that I nar@@ row@@ ly escap@@ ed with my life."

So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
"What do we do? Let's go@@ ."""
"And today, the hur@@ d@@ y-@@ g@@ ur@@ dy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional fol@@ k music, d@@ ance, con@@ tempor@@ ary and world music -- in the U.@@ K@@ ., in Fr@@ ance, in Spa@@ in and in Ital@@ y."
"So, there are 3@@ .@@ 5 billion women on ear@@ th."
"So, I decided that I wanted to investig@@ ate the econom@@ ics of terror@@ is@@ m."
"As I car@@ ried his body in my hands to lay it in the ground in J@@ une of last year, I realized I had paid a pro@@ found price for amp@@ li@@ fying my vo@@ ice."
"And if you really look into it, particularly when it comes to plastic bott@@ les, most of it is only down@@ -@@ cy@@ cle@@ d, or in@@ cin@@ er@@ ated, or shi@@ pped to Chin@@ a."
"But to do that, we'd have to be able to look at the planet@@ 's atmosp@@ here, because the atmosphere ac@@ ts like a blanket tra@@ pping heat -- the gre@@ en@@ house effe@@ ct."
"So I mean, the reason I put those things all together, OK, here's the way you're supposed to do science -- some science is done for other reas@@ ons, and just curi@@ osit@@ y."
"A@@ O@@ : -- who also was a pian@@ ist who couldn't see, and also, I think, like Dere@@ k, thought that all the world was a pian@@ o, so whenever Art Tat@@ um plays something, it sounds like there's three pian@@ os in the room."
"And all this stuff at the bottom is a muse@@ um, and an idea for a very f@@ ancy aut@@ omob@@ ile entr@@ y."
"Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is sou@@ p, you can ag@@ it@@ ate it and make those nu@@ cle@@ i be distribu@@ ted hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ously in the liqu@@ id, so that now by looking under the micro@@ sc@@ ope at just four or five sam@@ ples of this hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous solu@@ tion, you can coun@@ t nu@@ cle@@ i, and therefore tell how many cells that brain ha@@ d."
"You zoo@@ m in and you zoo@@ m in and you zoo@@ m in and you zoo@@ m in, and you can just read it now."
But main@@ ta@@ ining this her@@ d takes a major toll on our planet.
"This is Ar@@ te@@ mi@@ a, a br@@ ine sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ ."
"And one of my questions as a child was, wh@@ y?"
"Let's see, first iter@@ ation, second, thir@@ d, four@@ th."
"And I set up Kan@@ ch@@ i, because my organization was always going to be named after my eleph@@ ant, because dis@@ ability is like the eleph@@ ant in the room."
What's next for you@@ ? What's next for J@@ et@@ man@@ ?
"As a matter of fact, I would argue that there's a lot of very ci@@ vic@@ -@@ min@@ ded, dec@@ ent leader@@ shi@@ p."
"And today, 1,@@ 100 Americans are d@@ ying from c@@ igar@@ et@@ te smo@@ k@@ ing."
I want to have hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ ture and gre@@ en@@ hou@@ ses on top of res@@ identi@@ al are@@ as.
You can go and pick your Sen@@ ator and then you can see a list of bill@@ s they have spon@@ so@@ red.
"(Laughter) Un@@ happy with both op@@ tions, I did the only thing that made sense to me."
Com@@ par@@ ing with the past causes many of the problems that behavi@@ oral econom@@ ists and psycholog@@ ists identify in people's attemp@@ ts to as@@ sign valu@@ e.
"And then we have to say, ""How was your day@@ ?"
All this makes up a constru@@ ctive and as@@ c@@ ending social dynam@@ ic.
"What you need to do there seems like it might be simp@@ le, but it's no@@ t."
"This pie@@ ce, actually, will be on display down in the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a Sim@@ ul@@ cast Lo@@ unge in the breaks between now and the end of the show@@ ."
"And it's based on a few thousand people we've sam@@ p@@ led from, you know, a hand@@ ful of popul@@ ations around the world."
"(Laughter) (Applause) To@@ day, there are six survi@@ ving speci@@ es, and they fall into two grou@@ p@@ s."
"As wit@@ ness to their pas@@ sage, they left behind mysterious en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings and pain@@ t@@ ings, like this pan@@ el of human@@ s, tri@@ an@@ gles and z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag@@ s from O@@ j@@ o Gu@@ are@@ ñ@@ a in Spa@@ in."
"So, different species of plants grow in different plac@@ es, and some poll@@ en carries further than others."
"But what I want to sugges@@ t, and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these ill@@ ness@@ es."
"I gave them a computer with a spee@@ ch@@ -to-@@ text inter@@ fac@@ e, which you now get free with Win@@ dow@@ s, and asked them to speak into it."
"As we sp@@ in it, we can see many of the other in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate patterns con@@ tained in this one."
It's not a bad place to start a colon@@ y.
"I was just three years old when my brother came alon@@ g, and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life."
"@@ Par@@ t of that is tru@@ e, there aren't as many pro@@ min@@ ent women in technology."
"He used a to@@ aster ov@@ en, and he even made his own vor@@ te@@ x mix@@ er, based on a tu@@ tor@@ ial by another scient@@ ist@@ /@@ ma@@ k@@ er."
They happen somewhere else to somebody else or to us in a different way than we're used to experiencing it.
"And there's a lot of evidence that neu@@ ral activity is en@@ co@@ ding our though@@ ts, feelings and percep@@ tions, our mental experienc@@ es."
"And if it's the case, as we've been fin@@ d@@ ing, that the we@@ al@@ th@@ ier you are, the more enti@@ t@@ led you feel to that we@@ al@@ th, and the more likely you are to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze your own interes@@ ts above the interes@@ ts of other people, and be willing to do things to serve that self-@@ interes@@ t, well, then, there's no reason to think that those patterns will change."
So we need to recognize those hot spo@@ ts and do our best to protect them.
"But the thing is, empower@@ ment is an emo@@ tion."
And so the question is: How could we make that back@@ ?
"And I told him, ""@@ Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the countr@@ y."""
(Laughter) Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
"But in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber, remember, we're still in sou@@ th@@ west mon@@ so@@ on, Mal@@ di@@ ves is still in the sou@@ th@@ west mon@@ so@@ on."
That ch@@ in barbe@@ l is flas@@ h@@ ing.
"W@@ he@@ ther the same thing is true in A@@ D@@ H@@ D in humans we don't know, but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possi@@ bilit@@ y."
L@@ ast se@@ ction@@ : green arm@@ b@@ and. We've all got them.
"(Applause) (Appl@@ ause end@@ s) So, same question I asked you before, but this time you don't have to close your ey@@ es."
They are pl@@ in@@ ths for their cre@@ ations.
"Well I'm going to mat@@ ch families on country of bir@@ th and res@@ iden@@ ce, the demo@@ graph@@ ics -- what sex@@ , their age -- their income level within their own country, their educ@@ ational achievem@@ ent, a lot about their family structu@@ re."
"There's a book called ""@@ Wal@@ king on E@@ g@@ g@@ sh@@ ell@@ s@@ ,"" where they found actual sau@@ ro@@ po@@ d skin in Pat@@ ag@@ oni@@ a."
"(Laughter) Some of you may agree with him, or her, we don't know."
It's an interesting question.
"When some people think of fis@@ h@@ ing, they imagine relaxing in a boat and pati@@ ently re@@ el@@ ing in the day@@ 's cat@@ ch."
"It was Ap@@ ri@@ l, last year."
Let's start from the beginn@@ ing.
"I don't have a poin@@ ter here, but you see the gre@@ en, sort of re@@ ct@@ an@@ gle or tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ id@@ ?"
"If you want to make a din@@ osaur@@ , you go out, you find yourself a piece of pe@@ tri@@ fied tree sa@@ p -- other@@ wise known as am@@ ber -- that has some bloo@@ d-@@ su@@ cking inse@@ cts in it, good on@@ es, and you get your inse@@ ct and you dri@@ ll into it and you su@@ ck out some DN@@ A, because obviously all inse@@ cts that su@@ cked blood in those days su@@ cked din@@ osau@@ r DNA out."
"It's what we call a perfect fit of shape comple@@ ment@@ ar@@ ity, or hand in glo@@ ve."
"It's ju@@ st, it's difficult to describe this."
"At the end of this process, we have a mix@@ ed plastic compo@@ sit@@ e: many different types of plas@@ tics and many different gra@@ des of plas@@ tic@@ s."
"I mean, have a look at this graph@@ ."
"And if you play that well, you'll have other people invol@@ ved, so even that game ex@@ t@@ ends and continu@@ es even when you're g@@ one."
So it's not really a case of Mars and Ven@@ us.
I know they look si@@ ll@@ y. And sure they look si@@ ll@@ y.
"This is Reg@@ ina Hol@@ li@@ day, a pain@@ ter in Washing@@ ton D@@ C@@ , whose hus@@ band died of kid@@ ney cancer a year after my disea@@ se."
"W@@ riting is using your imagin@@ ation on pa@@ per, and I do get so scar@@ ed because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kid@@ s, that writing would be using your imagin@@ ation on pa@@ per, if they're allowed to even write now within the school hour@@ s."
But it's also about produc@@ ing a language to describe this.
"And I of course knew stuff@@ , as a design@@ er, about ty@@ po@@ graph@@ y, even though we worked with those animals not so success@@ ful@@ ly."
The great thing about a culture of gi@@ vers is that's not a del@@ usion -- it's reality.
"It won't say ""@@ check engine@@ ""@@ ; it@@ 'll be a ""@@ check your bod@@ y"" light, and you'll go get it taken care of."
"So A@@ ar@@ on Ko@@ bl@@ in and I began audi@@ tion@@ ing new technologies that could put more of you inside of the work, like your childhood home in ""The Wil@@ der@@ ness D@@ ow@@ n@@ tow@@ n@@ ,"" your hand@@ -@@ dra@@ wn portra@@ it@@ s, in ""The John@@ ny C@@ as@@ h Proje@@ ct@@ ,"" and your inter@@ active dreams in ""@@ 3 Dre@@ ams of Bl@@ ack@@ ."""
"Now, over the past 50 years, we as a society have come to view our companies and corpor@@ ations in a very nar@@ row@@ , almost mon@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al fashion with regar@@ d to how we value them, and we have put so much emp@@ has@@ is on pro@@ fit@@ s, on short@@ -@@ term quar@@ ter@@ ly ear@@ n@@ ings and share pri@@ c@@ es, at the ex@@ clusi@@ on of all else."
"F@@ em@@ in@@ ism is all about un@@ doing ster@@ eo@@ types about gen@@ der, so there's nothing fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ minis@@ m@@ ."""
And they've been able to say so because they've compared the two separate images with one taken pos@@ thum@@ ously from K@@ ati@@ e.
"C@@ and@@ les can't bur@@ n in a vac@@ u@@ um, there@@ fo@@ re, probably sparkl@@ ers wouldn't ei@@ ther."
"When you buy medicin@@ es, you get a list of side effe@@ ct@@ s."
"I@@ s this person more r@@ are than the other one@@ ?"""
"The recom@@ men@@ ded daily in@@ take var@@ ies from between 2.@@ 5@@ -@@ 3@@ .@@ 7 li@@ ters of water for men, and about 2-@@ 2.@@ 7 li@@ ters for women, a range that is p@@ ushed up or down if we are health@@ y, activ@@ e, old, or over@@ he@@ at@@ ing."
This is kind of like something I used to do in third gra@@ de.
"Every day I see my grand@@ children, about the same age as these young girl@@ s, and I do wonder@@ , and I get an@@ gr@@ y some@@ times, y@@ es I do."
I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are car@@ ved in st@@ one.
"The next morning, we clim@@ bed out of the ca@@ ve and hi@@ ked all the way to the top of the gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ , where we finally rig@@ ged and ra@@ pp@@ el@@ led this p@@ it for the very first time."
"G@@ ri@@ z@@ m@@ o doesn't need these particular skills to find and h@@ unt down dinner in her food bow@@ l today, but inst@@ inc@@ tu@@ ally, vie@@ wing the living room from the top of the book@@ case is exactly what she has evol@@ ved to do."
We need to teach our children how to artic@@ ul@@ ate their sens@@ ations so they're familiar with them.
I told him I didn't wear any ma@@ ke@@ up at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing.
"You know, this country is involved as we've all hear@@ d, in this great health@@ care de@@ bat@@ e."
"Because what they're doing is they're saying, your co@@ at@@ 's not so gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous, what's been ed@@ ited out is something important."
Don't we already know how they affect temper@@ atur@@ es?
"Because when poli@@ cies and infra@@ structure fa@@ il, this is what happens on a daily bas@@ is."
There was no money invol@@ ved.
I don't know any TED Tal@@ k that conta@@ ins this.
"Wh@@ ile electric power, cell serv@@ ice, and Internet would be down, most radi@@ os would likely survi@@ ve."
"On the ground, it's power@@ ed electri@@ call@@ y."
"So I want to s@@ um all this up with a cap@@ tion to a car@@ to@@ on, and I think this sum@@ s up the whole thing, really, about The New Yor@@ ker car@@ to@@ ons."
"There was photogra@@ phic re@@ call inside the children, I su@@ spe@@ ct because they're discus@@ sing with each other."
Loo@@ k at some stone tool@@ s.
"Just as consum@@ ers can be sold and res@@ old up@@ gra@@ ded ver@@ sions of an i@@ P@@ hon@@ e, so also people can be sold more and more educ@@ ation."
Do I agree with the assum@@ p@@ tion@@ s?
So there he is there.
Here you see pl@@ anks sold by the foot and we have supp@@ lies to com@@ bat sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y.
This next song is a song that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.
"They're all over the Internet, they're t@@ opping blo@@ g post@@ s and news pie@@ c@@ es, and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us, that when it comes to new working mo@@ ther@@ hood in America, every@@ thing@@ 's fin@@ e."
"Wh@@ ile it was known that auth@@ or@@ it@@ arian countries contro@@ lled and cen@@ so@@ red information, a series of sc@@ and@@ als showed that democra@@ tic governments were also mis@@ leading the publi@@ c@@ , often with media cooper@@ ation."
And so the Sen@@ ate won in the end.
It's already happen@@ ing. It's not science fiction.
It's a good wor@@ d.
We had deci@@ de@@ dly low-@@ te@@ ch communic@@ ations.
So what if we started using the five sens@@ es theory in all of our design@@ s?
This little sy@@ r@@ inge conta@@ ins the moral mole@@ cu@@ le.
S@@ uch a ran@@ dom jum@@ ble of let@@ ters is said to have a very high ent@@ rop@@ y.

"In China, by contra@@ st, people believe that the government is going to keep problems from happen@@ ing, which might not always be what happen@@ s, but people believe it."
"And while a more recent study did show that re@@ action times and err@@ ors increase for some bil@@ ing@@ ual students in cross@@ -@@ language test@@ s, it also showed that the eff@@ ort and attention needed to switch between languages trig@@ ger@@ ed more activity in, and potenti@@ ally strength@@ en@@ ed, the dor@@ sol@@ at@@ er@@ al pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex@@ ."
"I discovered a specific type of imm@@ une c@@ ell, the hel@@ per T c@@ ell, was present inside that material that I im@@ plan@@ ted and absolutely critical for wo@@ und heal@@ ing."
"W@@ hat's been very interesting is that in some countries -- not to call anyone out, but Den@@ mark and Nor@@ way -- in some countries, over@@ all cryst@@ all@@ ine I@@ Q has stopped or slo@@ wed down or decl@@ ine@@ d."
"And all the stuff I could af@@ for@@ d, I didn't like."
That's hor@@ ri@@ ble.
"And he@@ y, surpris@@ e, very high r@@ ates of HIV among people who are in@@ je@@ cting dru@@ gs."
"When I was yo@@ ung@@ er, I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pill@@ ar@@ s."

And I love the way those images are actually not telling you what to think.
I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to.
"And, of course, Ar@@ c@@ tic communities are to@@ ast@@ ."
The best we can be is like the old woman in that jo@@ ke -- I don't know if you've heard it.

It often gets hoo@@ ked on the wrong things.
"(Laughter) And some of them, many of them actually, had water that came into more than one room."
And you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rain@@ fall as well.
"Well, to conc@@ lu@@ de, I can say that we made a material using ste@@ el fi@@ ber@@ s, the addition of ste@@ el fi@@ ber@@ s, using in@@ duc@@ tion energy to really increase the surface life of the ro@@ ad, dou@@ ble the surface life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple trick@@ s."
"So, I thought I should start with some stor@@ ies."
"But those that do survi@@ ve, they carry forward long-term cogni@@ tive problems as well as lo@@ ss@@ es of stat@@ u@@ re."
There are so many cele@@ bri@@ ties running around here.
"And mo@@ re@@ over@@ , it pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly changes your percep@@ tions by what you do."
And the mother goes right through a red light.
"So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surger@@ y, are coun@@ sel@@ ed, and then there are bus@@ es wa@@ it@@ ing, which will transport them to the base hospit@@ al."
"The most important disco@@ very we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard cho@@ ices are not between good and ev@@ il, but between compe@@ ting goo@@ ds."
"They separate the parents from the children by promis@@ ing to provide food, clo@@ thing, shel@@ ter to these childr@@ en."
"There are lines in front of the one on the right, and there are lines behind the one on the left, and so it takes it into different plan@@ es."
"I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for@@ , these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous women, ""@@ Be@@ lie@@ ve in yourself and ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate for yourself@@ ."

"We might even call them citi@@ zen@@ s, because they've recently ris@@ en up to fight against leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative in@@ cur@@ sion, and the citiz@@ ens of these net@@ works work together to serve each other in great ways."

"Se@@ ver@@ al year later, I managed to success@@ fully fa@@ il all of my exam@@ s and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all, and my par@@ ents, maybe as a rewar@@ d, bought me what turned out to be a one-@@ way ti@@ cket to Australi@@ a, and I came back home about four years lat@@ er."
M@@ S: Wal@@ king the course is not part of the game of gol@@ f@@ ?

"But then -- and here's the tri@@ ck -- Fe@@ hr and G@@ äch@@ ter, on the se@@ vent@@ h ro@@ und, told people, ""You know what@@ ? New ru@@ le."

"B@@ et@@ ween 15@@ 20 and 18@@ 6@@ 7, 12 milli@@ on, 500 people were moved from high U@@ V to low U@@ V areas in the tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic sla@@ ve tra@@ de."
"So, for instance, we can p@@ lot the l@@ eng@@ th of the ed@@ ges."
"I will con@@ du@@ ct a couple of simple qu@@ eri@@ es, search qu@@ eri@@ es."
"@@ Like he did one with -- he had a little whe@@ el, like a f@@ an, that was sort of loo@@ sely atta@@ che@@ d, so it could sp@@ in by itself@@ ."
A@@ ge as potenti@@ al.
Gam@@ ma is just one of these compani@@ es.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
And I think that's sometimes an over@@ looked are@@ a.
"For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes, every single one of you stret@@ ched and comp@@ res@@ sed under the action of that wave -- when the waves h@@ it, they stret@@ ched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21@@ ."
"You come out of ""@@ Ar@@ ri@@ ve@@ "" at the air@@ por@@ t, and you follow a big yellow sign that says ""@@ Tra@@ ins@@ "" and it's in front of you."
"T@@ ra@@ y@@ von Mar@@ tin@@ , a 17@@ -year-old Bl@@ ack bo@@ y, a Bl@@ ack chil@@ d, remin@@ ded me remin@@ ded us how little this nation actually values Bl@@ ack life."
(Applause) OK.
That's just how the media has been portra@@ ying people who look like me.
"No wonder so many of my people sp@@ it bar@@ s, because the truth is hard to s@@ wal@@ low@@ ."
"And I think if we ph@@ ra@@ se that less@@ on, it's something like this: Don't ass@@ ume that what we currently think is out there is the full story."
"It teach@@ es kids to re-@@ vision their communi@@ ties, so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this."
"They see around cor@@ ner@@ s, sha@@ ping their future, not just reac@@ ting to it."
Not a good idea at all.
"We are looking at the emer@@ gen@@ ce of a car 2.@@ 0 -- a whole new marke@@ t, a whole new business model@@ ."
It was in actually a din@@ er outside of D@@ all@@ as@@ /@@ F@@ ort W@@ orth Air@@ p@@ ort.
I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history.
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Mil@@ ky Wa@@ y Galax@@ y.
Have you ever put on a pair of p@@ ants and then much later realized that there was a loo@@ se so@@ ck sm@@ ushed up against your th@@ igh@@ ?
And I'm inten@@ sely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.
So we started with a question: Do they love us@@ ?
"P@@ lay it well, and your days will be mostly jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ."""
"And if there is anything that I can do, if I can do anything to make you do the things you don't want to do, so you can have what you want, I will do it."
"So the only thing I can think of is say, ""@@ List@@ en. Let me tell you a story."
And we all think our kids will be especially tal@@ en@@ ted.
I love D@@ onn@@ a Mar@@ t@@ in.
"And that's the deep se@@ a, that's the environment that we consider to be among the most pr@@ ist@@ ine left on Ear@@ th."
And I'm incredibly proud of that.
We see light refle@@ cted off the Mo@@ on.
"We would use conven@@ tional metho@@ d@@ s; I have a cross@@ bow -- you see it in my hand there, which we use to sam@@ ple wh@@ ales and dolph@@ ins for genetic studies as well."
I think we need to allow challeng@@ ing.
"(Laughter) So, there's a kind of British under@@ stat@@ em@@ ent, mur@@ der@@ -@@ myster@@ y theme that I really love very much."
So this episode laun@@ ched a lifelong qu@@ est for my identi@@ ty.
"Y@@ es, it's the first sentence of Fran@@ z Kaf@@ ka@@ 's ""The Met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ sis@@ ."""
So it re-@@ shows the brain makes predi@@ ctions and fundament@@ ally changes the prec@@ ep@@ ts.
"So M@@ el@@ cher Medi@@ a's te@@ am, who's on the East co@@ ast -- and we're on the West co@@ ast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, dra@@ gs in images and tex@@ t."
I think he knew what the s@@ cars on his face would say to the rest of the world.
"There's nothing like it in the land@@ ."""
And it@@ ’s not just lung canc@@ er.
"And one thing you need to know about drag@@ on@@ fli@@ es, one important thing, is that they lay their eg@@ gs in fresh water."
"We don't need to inv@@ ent solutions because we have them -- cas@@ h flow lo@@ ans based in income rather than asse@@ ts, lo@@ ans that use secure contra@@ cts rather than coll@@ at@@ er@@ al, because women often don't own land@@ ."
"He said it was his profi@@ le. ""@@ Then what are you@@ ?"" I as@@ ked. ""@@ An actor@@ ,"" he sa@@ i@@ d."
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves sm@@ aller@@ ?
"(Applause) If you, as a matter of fact, put four mar@@ bles in@@ side, you simul@@ ate the molecular structure of me@@ th@@ an@@ e, C@@ H@@ 4@@ ."
"They're feed@@ ing our children every single day, and before a child can lear@@ n, their bel@@ ly needs to be ful@@ l, and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educ@@ ated socie@@ ty."
"After all, I've been spending 60 years here belie@@ ving it's going to happen tomorrow@@ ."
"That's righ@@ t; in just a few minut@@ es, a pattern invol@@ ving millions of neur@@ ons is being tel@@ ep@@ or@@ ted into 1,@@ 200 min@@ ds, just by people listening to a voice and watching a fac@@ e."
But let's go back and drop it a little deep@@ er and look during the day@@ time.
"So I typ@@ ed up a bud@@ ge@@ t, a materials list@@ , a tim@@ el@@ ine, and a proce@@ du@@ re, and I ema@@ iled it to 200 different pro@@ fess@@ ors at John@@ s H@@ op@@ k@@ ins University and the National Institu@@ tes of Health -- essenti@@ ally, anyone that had anything to do with pan@@ creati@@ c canc@@ er."
"When life brought about a series of death and near@@ -@@ death experiences within my close cir@@ c@@ le, which high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for an emer@@ gen@@ cy medical response service in India, similar to 9@@ 11 in US@@ A."
And B@@ -@@ re@@ x was found under a thousand cu@@ bi@@ c yar@@ ds of rock.
And they're r@@ ushing around all stressed out.
Because I think it's an ur@@ gen@@ t question.
"And she@@ 'd say, ""I'm not tal@@ k@@ ing."""
"He was working for the US government, and one of the ideas that he put for@@ th was, ""W@@ ow, humans are creating so much information, and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read or the conne@@ ctions between important ide@@ as@@ ."""
"And although we don't yet have an Ara@@ b Kin@@ se@@ y Re@@ p@@ ort to tell us exactly what's happening inside bedro@@ om@@ s across the Ara@@ b regi@@ on, It's pretty clear that something is not right."
"It happened again about 1@@ 20 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some so@@ lit@@ ary wa@@ sp@@ s began creating little simp@@ le, primi@@ tive n@@ est@@ s, or hi@@ ves."
"""I found these stamp@@ s as a chil@@ d, and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to."
"And so fundament@@ ally, rather th@@ an, for example, meas@@ uring content based on how many people are watch@@ ing, this gives us the basic data for looking at enga@@ gement proper@@ ties of cont@@ ent."
"We're asking things like@@ : Is this Ox@@ f@@ am don@@ ation for@@ m, where the reg@@ ular month@@ ly don@@ ation is the pres@@ et de@@ faul@@ t, and people, maybe without int@@ ending it, are encou@@ ra@@ ged or nu@@ d@@ ged into giving a reg@@ ular don@@ ation instead of a one-@@ time don@@ ation, is that ""@@ still@@ ' per@@ mis@@ si@@ ble@@ ?"
"It is interesting that in the United Stat@@ es, the most significant health@@ -@@ care bud@@ get goes to car@@ dio@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease car@@ e, whether it's private or publi@@ c@@ ."
(Applause) There was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell a@@ par@@ t.
"The aut@@ omob@@ ile be@@ com@@ es, then, an app@@ li@@ ance -- not in a com@@ mod@@ ity sense, but an app@@ li@@ ance, mobile power, mobile plat@@ form for information and comput@@ ing and communic@@ ation, as well as a form of transport@@ ation."
"As he said to me, that really p@@ is@@ sed the French off."
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle A@@ ges@@ ?
"And when I had this thought, I was imag@@ ining that I would make -- I would have a whole machine theater evening, where I would -- you would have an audi@@ ence, the cur@@ tain would op@@ en, and you'd be entertain@@ ed by machines on sta@@ ge."
But what actually interes@@ ts me a lot more is the fact that in the ti@@ p of each contro@@ ll@@ er is a rel@@ atively high-@@ per@@ forming inf@@ rar@@ ed camer@@ a.
"So we want things that n@@ est, we want things that stac@@ k, and we want it di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze@@ d."
"And when they do, we say that they've solved the puzz@@ le."
"I really am hon@@ ored to be here, and as Chris said, it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa@@ ."
"But sometimes I see this ing@@ eni@@ ous idea in there, and I have this eu@@ re@@ ka moment."
It's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clo@@ ck.
"This is what I came to graduate school for@@ , and this is how I would rather spend my life."
"The word is ""@@ re@@ wil@@ ding@@ ,"" and even though re@@ wil@@ ding is a young wor@@ d, it already has several defini@@ tions."
They're not as true as they could be.
"On your way to the air@@ por@@ t, if you pick up your boar@@ ding pas@@ s, it can tell you that your flight is del@@ a@@ ye@@ d, that the g@@ ate has change@@ d, etc."
He was sending me an original po@@ em that he had com@@ posed after our Tu@@ es@@ day morning together.
"And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respe@@ ct, instead of fear@@ ."
There's an air je@@ t that dri@@ es you.
And they themselves had not known they car@@ ed.
"I mean, other animals may well have imagin@@ ations and creativ@@ ity, but it's not so much in eviden@@ ce, is it, as our@@ s?"
"(Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, El@@ on, about what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer feel gu@@ il@@ ty about energ@@ y."
But the more natural compar@@ ison is actually between India and Pakist@@ an.
And what it is -- it's actually ste@@ ak.
You want to hear it played by different musici@@ ans.
"So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of, which might be ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es, other religi@@ ons, maybe I'm afraid of terror@@ ists or shar@@ ks, anything that makes me feel@@ , ass@@ ume you're going to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate the problem."
"And it's open to us to intro@@ du@@ ce a new way of doing that, and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minut@@ es, or whatever the time rema@@ in@@ s."
"I'm going to play you now a sam@@ ple of someone who ha@@ s, two people actually, who have sever@@ e speech dis@@ order@@ s."
"But as people get more conserv@@ ative, the values ris@@ e."
So I try to create this energy of inven@@ tion every day in my studi@@ o.
Who says A@@ ? Who says B@@ ?
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suit@@ case today.
"So that's potenti@@ ally absolutely dis@@ rup@@ tive technology, and, I gu@@ ess, pa@@ ves the way for your dream to actually ta@@ ke, at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scal@@ e."
They're helping each other do it.
"From the very first re@@ hear@@ s@@ al, I saw the bright future a@@ head@@ ."
"Now, this Pe@@ ñ@@ a hardly inspired much confidence at fir@@ st."
"If you don't know about ""@@ Spir@@ ited A@@ wa@@ y"" and its dire@@ ct@@ or, Ha@@ y@@ ao Mi@@ y@@ a@@ z@@ ak@@ i, first of all, you're wel@@ com@@ e."
"You know, sometimes there's a 10@@ -@@ , 15@@ -@@ minute break out there when you're waiting for a wave to come in."
"J@@ F: Well, women are the fast@@ est growing demo@@ graphic in the world, especially older women."
"It was the bir@@ th of my daughter that inspired me to la@@ unch this climate organiz@@ ation, in order to counter@@ act the exc@@ es@@ sive pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation of this issue in the United Stat@@ es, and to find a conserv@@ ative path@@ way forwar@@ d."
"And to this day, I have no answer for you."
And sle@@ ight of hand is just an art@@ ful demon@@ stration of de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity.
That's the kind of power I feel in this room.
"To dimension@@ alize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies made -- for car@@ s, for compu@@ ters, for phon@@ es, for flas@@ h@@ ligh@@ ts, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electri@@ cal energy the world us@@ es."
"Now, what you can't see is that our genetic program instru@@ cts these bacteria to each produce small molecul@@ es, and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off."
"Well, instead of doing all of the spac@@ e@@ craft n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation here on the Earth, what if we let the spac@@ e@@ craft n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate themsel@@ ves@@ ?"
"As a resul@@ t, the way we think, we ac@@ t, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvi@@ ous."
"And they do cla@@ im -- you know, this is an interesting ju@@ x@@ ta@@ position of the King James Bib@@ le and ""How To S@@ ell Y@@ our@@ self@@ ."""
Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live her@@ e?
K@@ B: Can you show us where@@ ?
"B@@ M@@ I is fair@@ ly connected to your lifesty@@ le, but we still c@@ an, we get in the ball@@ par@@ k, eight ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of prec@@ isi@@ on."
It's going to be machin@@ e-@@ rea@@ da@@ ble.
M@@ T: B@@ y@@ e by@@ e. (Music) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
John@@ Ed@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .@@ co@@ m [@@ Dam@@ n liber@@ al@@ ] (Laughter) So we keep on insul@@ ting people left and right every@@ day.
So what did we fin@@ d?
But algorith@@ m@@ ic bi@@ as can also lead to discrimin@@ at@@ ory practic@@ es.
We are at a remarkable moment in time.
It can break sometimes.
"M@@ el G@@ ib@@ son did the sequ@@ el, you may have seen it."
This was the third trip.
And I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the ani@@ ma@@ tion.
"What it does is -- this is what's happening in Los Al@@ tos -- it fre@@ es up time -- it's the blo@@ cking and t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing, making sure you know how to move through a system of equ@@ ations, and it fre@@ es up time for the simul@@ ations, for the gam@@ es, for the mechan@@ ics, for the robo@@ t-@@ build@@ ing, for the estim@@ ating how high that hil@@ l is based on its shadow@@ ."
"First of all, there's a real de@@ ar@@ th of data in the de@@ bat@@ e."
"There's n@@ ano@@ technology coming on, n@@ an@@ omat@@ eri@@ als."
"Now that's one thing, of cour@@ se."
"So in 201@@ 1, I al@@ ter@@ ed my name so that I could particip@@ ate in F@@ ar R@@ ight you@@ th camp in H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y."
And one of them was [@@ un@@ clear@@ ] who taught us physic@@ s.
"How does evolution do c@@ umul@@ ative, combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al thing@@ s?"
"S@@ l@@ ums are an im@@ perfect hou@@ sing solu@@ tion, but they are also pri@@ me examples of the innov@@ ation, ada@@ pt@@ ability and res@@ ili@@ ence at the foundation -- and the heart -- of every fun@@ c@@ tional city."
"H@@ um@@ ans, particularly so, we're very im@@ it@@ ative cre@@ atur@@ es."
"In Keny@@ a, 198@@ 4 is known as the year of the c@@ up, or the g@@ or@@ o g@@ or@@ o."
I cap@@ tu@@ red my ob@@ serv@@ ations through time@@ -@@ lap@@ se photography.
"They don't use words like ""@@ left@@ "" and ""@@ righ@@ t."""
"S@@ cu@@ ba diver@@ s can't get there, sub@@ mar@@ ines go right on past it."
So it makes the materials environmentally active and inter@@ active.
"And they have belief@@ s about what other people want, and what other people don't want, how much power other people have, how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you wan@@ t."
So the college works following the lifestyle and work@@ style of Ma@@ hat@@ ma Gand@@ hi@@ .
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cas@@ es.
"G@@ row@@ ing a mush@@ room is also part of a larger practice of cul@@ tiv@@ ating de@@ compo@@ sing organisms called de@@ comp@@ icul@@ ture, a concept that was developed by an ent@@ om@@ olog@@ ist, Tim@@ o@@ thy M@@ yl@@ es."
Lich@@ ens aro@@ se as a co@@ -@@ op@@ . F@@ ung@@ i married al@@ ga@@ e ...
"In@@ cor@@ rec@@ t, abo@@ ve, which is what almost every swimming co@@ ach will teach you."
"So my final plan@@ k is, tell your story."
"Another issue is, a cit@@ y's like our family portra@@ it."
That way you could listen to cool music while you pret@@ end to look for a job and you're really just chat@@ tin@@ ' with your p@@ als.
"And in this, you'd have like a -- something that looks like a clou@@ d, and it is a clou@@ d at the same time."
O@@ n the left we see people dy@@ ing@@ ; we see people running for their lives.
"At our lab Ro@@ Me@@ L@@ a, the Robo@@ tics and Mechan@@ is@@ ms L@@ abor@@ ator@@ y, we have these fantastic brain@@ stor@@ ming ses@@ sion@@ s."
And I worked in min@@ es. And I realized that this was a world un@@ se@@ en.
They got 50 in@@ ches in three days.
"So, one of my most illu@@ stri@@ ous fore@@ be@@ ars at Man@@ ches@@ ter Univers@@ ity, Er@@ n@@ est Ru@@ ther@@ for@@ d, discover@@ er of the atom@@ ic nu@@ cle@@ us, once said, ""@@ All science is either physics or stam@@ p colle@@ ct@@ ing."""
"You mean all that time, up ti@@ ll today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it@@ ?"""
But then they went bank@@ ru@@ pt and they never off@@ ered it.
"I worked a long time on fig@@ uring out how to move the arms over a much greater ar@@ c -- that is up and down -- and make them a lot easi@@ er, so that you didn't have to use a but@@ ton@@ ."
"You might think of this as kind of like a primi@@ tive cell@@ . It is a simple chemical model of a living c@@ ell, and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together, play together in a complex network to produce something that we call ali@@ ve."
It became easier to feel a sense of normal@@ cy.
"The police res@@ cu@@ ed this gir@@ l, two other girl@@ s, and ar@@ res@@ ted three men, all at the Mo@@ tel 6 in San Jo@@ se."
"But every single year, we have problems of f@@ loo@@ ding due to rain@@ ."
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
"Well actually, I was not si@@ ll@@ y."
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
"So I said it was the che@@ ap@@ est and fast@@ est way to do it, but in fact, actually, as you sa@@ w, they weren't able to do it, so it may not be so chea@@ p and fa@@ st."
And the light that sh@@ one off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed fore@@ ver.
"That's certainly the case with robo@@ tics, but they also change the experience of the war@@ ri@@ or and even the very identi@@ ty of the war@@ ri@@ or."
He's over there.
It's amazing.
Th@@ ree gra@@ ms a day.
"And along comes p@@ ne@@ um@@ o@@ co@@ cc@@ us or another bacteri@@ a, stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ cc@@ us and bo@@ om, they get a bacteri@@ al p@@ ne@@ um@@ oni@@ a."
