"For the rest@@ , we are all absolutely identi@@ cal@@ ."
"I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can, we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel@@ , and the stu@@ b@@ born beli@@ ef that we are somehow different, that someone we love would never think of hur@@ ting themselves or someone el@@ se, can cause us to miss what's hidden in pla@@ in si@@ gh@@ t."

"But one thing I didn't men@@ tion was that very early on into her treat@@ ment, my wife and I decided that we would take the pas@@ sen@@ ger@@ 's se@@ at."
"Well, I bet I know how you'd solve that problem if you solved it."
And we have always thought of it as just sort of this pas@@ sive proper@@ ty.
"M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y G@@ ell@@ -@@ Man@@ n@@ : Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the ca@@ ve pain@@ t@@ ings and ca@@ ve en@@ grav@@ ings and ca@@ ve sculp@@ tures and dance ste@@ ps in the soft cla@@ y in the ca@@ ves in Western Euro@@ pe, in the Au@@ ri@@ g@@ na@@ cian P@@ eri@@ od some 3@@ 5@@ ,000 years ago, or earli@@ er."
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-@@ visual user inter@@ fac@@ es.
"It's free cooking les@@ son@@ s, guy@@ s, in the Ma@@ in Stre@@ et."
But race also ten@@ ds to overwhel@@ m the clinical meas@@ ures.
"Most of the stories that these women, total stran@@ ger@@ s, send to me now, are not actually even about brea@@ st@@ feed@@ ing."
"We interview@@ ed coup@@ les who received fer@@ til@@ ity treatment at G@@ h@@ ent University H@@ os@@ pit@@ al, using sper@@ m from a don@@ or."
"So about that time, the National Fe@@ der@@ ation of the B@@ lin@@ d, or N@@ F@@ B@@ , challeng@@ ed the research commit@@ te@@ e about who can develop a car that le@@ ts a blind person drive saf@@ ely and indepen@@ dent@@ ly."
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 199@@ 0@@ s?
"We then make that a video game to give patients simple, motiv@@ ating objec@@ tives to follow@@ ."
(Laughter) You can't have chemical@@ -free lu@@ mp char@@ co@@ al.
"Now, if that sounds pre@@ post@@ er@@ ous to you, or, you know, kind of craz@@ y, I'm right there with you, because fran@@ k@@ ly, if I ha@@ dn't seen the evidence for myself, deca@@ des of evidence for myself, I am fairly sure that I wouldn't believe it ei@@ ther@@ ."
girl@@ s.
"What S@@ UN@@ D@@ A@@ R stan@@ ds for@@ , in H@@ indi@@ , is ""@@ attrac@@ tiv@@ e."""
It's e@@ ka@@ -@@ alu@@ minu@@ m. So were Men@@ dele@@ ev@@ 's predic@@ tions right@@ ?
Because I'm femal@@ e.
"And then bring a team of experts in there to metho@@ dic@@ ally go through exactly what these people do, to dis@@ till down the cros@@ s-@@ cultural dis@@ ti@@ lla@@ tion."
(Laughter) So we've seen neuro@@ -@@ fla@@ p@@ do@@ o@@ dle all over the head@@ lin@@ es.
"I hun@@ g up and I started call@@ ing those plac@@ es, but it took me virtu@@ ally no time at all to discover that many of these faci@@ li@@ ties are ge@@ ar@@ ed towards those batt@@ ling long-term substan@@ ce use disor@@ der."
What if everything we needed to realize our aspira@@ tion for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be cla@@ i@@ med@@ ?
"The really cool ad@@ v@@ ance with func@@ tional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just an@@ ato@@ my but activ@@ ity, that is, where neurons are fir@@ ing."
It can be that people don't want to be friends with the girl that starts scre@@ am@@ ing in an al@@ ge@@ bra les@@ son.
That's the problem.
"In our Western cultur@@ es, it means er@@ adi@@ ca@@ ting or rever@@ sing a disease, but in different cultur@@ es, for example, a culture from Asi@@ a, from the Mediter@@ ran@@ e@@ an, from L@@ atin countries, from Afri@@ ca, it can mean many more things."
"And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like some@@ thing@@ 's mis@@ sing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emo@@ tion."
"As the bacteria bur@@ sts, the pha@@ ges move out and go on the hun@@ t again for a new bacteria to infec@@ t."
"And finally, there was a population of students that were taught in a one-@@ on-@@ one instru@@ ction using a tu@@ tor."
"And actually, I have some examp@@ les, because what's better re@@ ven@@ ge than dis@@ playing their i@@ di@@ oc@@ y?"
"And by the way, this is one of the most fundamental discover@@ ies of modern micro@@ bio@@ log@@ y."
"You know, I was wonder@@ ing about Fre@@ u@@ di@@ an determin@@ ant@@ s: Why K@@ er@@ mit@@ ?"
And that's when I discovered come@@ dy.
"But by far the worst thing we do to mal@@ es, by making them feel that they have to be hard, is that we leave them with very fra@@ gi@@ le eg@@ os."
(Applause) We have to recognize a couple of things here.
"And this mar@@ ked the start of an ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ year-@@ long correspon@@ dence that God knows was never easy, but always honest@@ ."
"P@@ ut the sun and the moon shining together, it's brigh@@ t@@ ness."
"Well, it depends on what you think of as our bodi@@ es."
You will see how that go@@ es.
I think it would be a better world.
"Now this, for me, is a common situa@@ tion."
"One is, we can make better use of the oil that we have, and that's anal@@ og@@ ous to making better use of existing antibio@@ tics, and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a secon@@ d, but the other option is the ""@@ dri@@ ll@@ , bab@@ y, dri@@ ll@@ "" op@@ tion, which in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibio@@ tics."
And we make a dro@@ p@@ -@@ in replac@@ ement for that plastic that's made from petro@@ chemical@@ s.
"They're rela@@ ted, because if we invest he@@ avi@@ ly in new oil well@@ s, we reduce the incen@@ tives for conser@@ vation of oil in the same way that's going to happen for antibio@@ tics."
You really are alive right here in this moment.
"So for example, if you were to walk into a ba@@ ker@@ y, your brain might predict that you will encoun@@ ter the delicious aroma of freshly ba@@ ked chocolate chi@@ p cooki@@ es."
"And as you see it come out, in order to actually be able to do anything use@@ ful, it can't all stay clu@@ ster@@ ed up like this."
The video game industry in 200@@ 5 became a 2@@ 9 billion dollar business.
We are good at making w@@ ar.
"So what I've been discus@@ sing is, the seven and a half billion people in the world don't actually deserve to have their environment s@@ ma@@ shed by plas@@ tic, their oce@@ ans ren@@ der@@ ed de@@ pa@@ u@@ per@@ ate or bar@@ ren of sea life because of plas@@ tic."
"And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastin@@ ation."
S@@ pir@@ itu@@ al@@ it@@ y? And how about how we soci@@ aliz@@ e?
"But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our ac@@ tions, we let go of old hab@@ its and form new on@@ es."
This was a good day.
It's not pleas@@ ant.
And then there are very fine things.
I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life.
"And tra@@ gi@@ cally in [@@ 200@@ 3@@ ]@@ , a scientist was taken down and dro@@ w@@ ne@@ d, and she was being consu@@ med by a leopar@@ d se@@ al."
And this is also what it's like when the drug trade and use affects every aspect of life in the neighbor@@ hood.
"R@@ igh@@ t? It is trau@@ matic stress like active combat or natural disa@@ sters or community violence or sexual assault that causes post@@ -@@ trau@@ matic stress disor@@ der, and not everyone that is ex@@ posed to stress develop@@ s a mood disor@@ der."
"He's like, ""You idio@@ t. You mor@@ on."
"S@@ ti@@ ll@@ , good inten@@ tions can have un@@ inten@@ ded consequ@@ ences, and so I want to pro@@ pose that stories are not as magical as they see@@ m."
"And this ability to experience stress and be resili@@ ent and boun@@ ce back and not develop depression or P@@ T@@ S@@ D is known as stress resili@@ ence, and it vari@@ es between people."
We look at the sav@@ ings rate and it has been de@@ cl@@ ining since the 19@@ 50@@ s.
"Bu@@ il@@ dings are complex eco@@ systems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us, and some that are bad for us."
"F@@ i@@ ve years in gra@@ d school, a few years, you know, I'm at Nor@@ th@@ w@@ ester@@ n, I moved to Har@@ var@@ d, I'm at Har@@ var@@ d, I'm not really thinking about it any@@ more, but for a long time I had been thinking, ""@@ Not supposed to be her@@ e."""
"And you might be thinking, well, that's not particularly stress@@ ful."
"When you're in the low-@@ power pose condition, only 60 percent@@ , and that's a wh@@ opp@@ ing significant differ@@ ence."
"So that when we begin to gra@@ pp@@ le with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, ""@@ Can we build it@@ ?"""
"And she became D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff@@ , the pres@@ i@@ dent@@ -@@ elec@@ t of one of the biggest democra@@ ci@@ es in the world, moving from min@@ ister of energy to pres@@ i@@ dent@@ ."
Who are you?
"(Laughter) So ide@@ ally, what you want to do is a tri@@ al."
"The simple answer is: no one has developed this kind of a drug yet, at least not one that confor@@ ms to the Western regul@@ atory standar@@ ds that set the nor@@ m for so much of the world."
"And the other present was a photo of my grand@@ mother@@ , who committed suici@@ de."
So it was kind of weir@@ d to see those images and those eyes st@@ are back at me through a televi@@ sion.
It's a remark@@ ably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.
"All this complex@@ ity, all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated univer@@ se."
And I ended the study the next day.
"But the world has change@@ d, and it's over@@ due to up@@ grade that mind@@ set and that tax@@ on@@ o@@ my of the world, and to understand it."
"For example, commun@@ ality app@@ lies most naturally within family or friends, but it can be used to try to transfer the ment@@ ality of sharing to groups that ordin@@ ar@@ ily would not be dis@@ posed to exercise it."
I'm not interested in fil@@ ming the violence and the weap@@ ons.
L@@ as@@ sa virus is a lot like E@@ bo@@ la.
"This is a sun plac@@ ed with the origin@@ , because Jap@@ an lies to the e@@ ast of Chin@@ a."
"But occa@@ sion@@ ally, just occa@@ sion@@ ally, I hope you will open up your suit@@ cases for other people to see, because the world needs you and it needs the things you car@@ r@@ y."
"When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which -- I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the ker@@ nel@@ , we have 1@@ ,000 people involved in every single release and that's every two months, rou@@ gh@@ ly two or three month@@ s."
"The first brain@@ -@@ control@@ led ex@@ os@@ ke@@ let@@ on to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist e@@ ver, Al@@ ber@@ to San@@ tos Du@@ mon@@ t, wh@@ o, on Oc@@ to@@ ber 19@@ , 19@@ 0@@ 1, created and fle@@ w himself the first control@@ led air@@ ship on air in Par@@ is for a million people to se@@ e."
This increased representa@@ tion can lead to phan@@ tom pain.
"But that day, I watched in wonder as the words stre@@ a@@ med out of my pen@@ , for@@ ming the most pi@@ vo@@ tal letter I've ever writ@@ ten, addres@@ sed to To@@ m."
The learning cur@@ ve was very long@@ .
"The resul@@ t, put another way, was hel@@ l."
"I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocola@@ te, whose kin@@ k@@ y hair could not form pon@@ y@@ tail@@ s, could also exist in literat@@ u@@ re."
"At five years old, I thought everyone was just like me."
"And we know that you can be lon@@ ely in a crowd and you can be lon@@ ely in a marri@@ age, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship@@ , but it's the quality of your close relationships that mat@@ ter@@ s."
"I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time manag@@ e@@ ment, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are gener@@ ally certain but specifically remain ambi@@ gu@@ ous."
"(Applause) And I want to be clear about what I'm saying, because I deeply believe our offi@@ ces should be encoura@@ ging casu@@ al, cha@@ tty ca@@ fe@@ -@@ style types of interac@@ tions -- you know, the kind where people come together and seren@@ di@@ pit@@ ously have an exchange of ideas."
But their habit of treating patients by race la@@ gs far behin@@ d.
So it's either a large body or a large number of neuron@@ s.
"What we'd really like is a quick fix@@ , something we can get that@@ 'll make our lives good and keep them that way."
You begin dro@@ w@@ ning in wor@@ ries about dan@@ gers that aren't present.
This has to do with writing direction.
"Your brain is basically making predic@@ tions, gues@@ ses, that it's construc@@ ting in the moment with billions of neurons working together."
And what we ulti@@ mately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of micro@@ organis@@ ms insi@@ de.
And you can see that the camera is tra@@ cking him and er@@ as@@ ing.
"Bu@@ t, there is good new@@ s."
"T@@ w@@ ent@@ y years ago, a new generation of anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs were brought in@@ ; the promi@@ se was they would have fe@@ wer side effec@@ ts."
"The web@@ site says, ""@@ If you loo@@ k, there's an individual muta@@ tion, and maybe a secon@@ d, and maybe a thir@@ d, and that is cancer@@ ."""
So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can ta@@ ke.
They are places for acu@@ te trauma and tre@@ a@@ table illness.
"It's a be@@ ard tri@@ m@@ mer@@ , you see@@ ?"
And one of the second common@@ est is carto@@ ons.
"So, I want to just re@@ mind every@@ body, throughout the world, one of the things is, we have pow@@ er, poor people have pow@@ er, every citiz@@ en has pow@@ er."
T: I don't ever want to let my country down@@ !
No open surgery was necessary.
You've read about it al@@ read@@ y.
"The drug l@@ or@@ ds were kind of worried about us fil@@ ming in the place, so I told them, ""You know wha@@ t?"
She had for@@ gotten to make that clear earli@@ er because she assu@@ med it was ... obvi@@ ous.
"What they're pro@@ posing is an almost four@@ -@@ times increase in produc@@ tion, and that would industri@@ alize an area the size of F@@ l@@ ori@@ da."
"So beyond s@@ pati@@ al memor@@ y, if we look for this gri@@ d-@@ like fir@@ ing pattern throughout the whole brain, we see it in a whole series of loca@@ tions which are always active when we do all kinds of auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal memory task@@ s, like rememb@@ ering the last time you went to a we@@ d@@ ding, for examp@@ le."
"I used to think I have to accompli@@ sh all these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur@@ , or get a Ph@@ D to teach -- but no, I just as@@ ked, and I could teach@@ ."
"Now, for my organization Glo@@ bal W@@ it@@ ness, this ex@@ pos@@ é has been phenomen@@ al."
It's not because their DNA has de@@ gener@@ ated.
"So, with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all, and we can see it all."
"Now, can anybody spo@@ t a fla@@ w in this desig@@ n@@ ?"
This is the result that's been rep@@ lica@@ ted over and over again.
"When we measure them in the lab@@ , they're really bad@@ ."
(Laughter) But the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue ball@@ s.
We're not going to be able to make a dinosau@@ r based on a dinosaur@@ .
We also have to have energy.
"And we predic@@ ted what would happen@@ , and we got it all wron@@ g."
And you must have seen this illu@@ sion.
"It creates a reality of mone@@ y, proper@@ ty, government, marri@@ age, CE@@ R@@ N confer@@ ences, cock@@ tail parties and summer vaca@@ tions, and all of those are crea@@ tions of conscious@@ ness."
There are people who care about the U@@ I@@ .
It was the best thing that ever happened in my life.
"W@@ ho@@ , I won@@ dere@@ d, is going to give them imagination and sta@@ mina and bra@@ very when the stor@@ ms come@@ ?"
Let's picture your risk of Alzheimer's as a see@@ -@@ saw scal@@ e.
"And the power of this is not that it's done occa@@ sion@@ ally, the power is it's done every week for a life@@ time."
"So the more dust you have, the more it will reve@@ al the pho@@ to."
"When I was learning Span@@ is@@ h, I was bor@@ ed with the text in the tex@@ t@@ boo@@ k."
"(Laughter) S@@ end 1,@@ 500 p@@ ounds via a Gi@@ ant Gu@@ m@@ my Li@@ zar@@ d."""
Because living so health@@ ily was kill@@ ing me.
But let's not stop at that.
"Now there's just one problem with this line of reason@@ ing, and that's that the insul@@ a does a lo@@ t."
"Secon@@ d, I call this ""the mi@@ xer@@ ."""
But fo@@ cus@@ ing only on the rate of prescri@@ b@@ ing risks over@@ looking two cruci@@ ally important poin@@ ts.
"What all administra@@ tions say when there's a scan@@ dal@@ : ""@@ Don't blame us. It's not the system."
Maybe we've all been this gu@@ y.
I mean that's a fab@@ ul@@ ous amount of money.
"You're probably thinking, my kid would never sex@@ t."
So the tall@@ est person of all time was a guy named Robert W@@ ad@@ low who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 1@@ 1.
"L@@ ast words said to his mother who was also tort@@ u@@ red to death@@ : ""@@ Don't wor@@ ry. The United N@@ ations are com@@ ing."""
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.
"(Laughter) I said, ""@@ So@@ lo@@ mon@@ , I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspon@@ den@@ ce@@ : L@@ aw@@ y@@ er@@ : Gu@@ m@@ my B@@ ear@@ ."
"Now, the same holds for train@@ ing@@ -@@ based treat@@ ments."
"And I was like, ""O@@ K, smart guy@@ s, this is what's happening to me, and if you have an explan@@ ation for me, I would love to hear it."""
I went to the eye of the stor@@ m.
And that got me thinking about a web@@ site that I had learned about a few months pri@@ or called Chan@@ ge@@ .@@ org@@ .
"There will still be expensive treat@@ ments, huge fri@@ ction from our insur@@ ance system."
"And that's sort of the body chan@@ nel of emotional empath@@ y, which many animals ha@@ ve."
"And when we sequ@@ ence the DNA from these animals, we find that the change in the DNA has occur@@ red at exactly the place where we indu@@ ced it, using the CRISPR technolog@@ y."
We all know that explor@@ ation is risk@@ y.
I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice co@@ ach@@ es.
"If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way, you do it vi@@ gor@@ ously, you can actually get a local er@@ adi@@ ca@@ tion."
"At the University of Hel@@ sin@@ ki@@ , I had a friend who was one of the open source -- it was called main@@ ly ""@@ free softwar@@ e@@ "" back then -- and he actually introdu@@ ced me to the no@@ tion that, he@@ y, you can use these open-@@ source licen@@ ses that had been aroun@@ d."
"With the fast@@ -@@ food industry you know, it's very competi@@ tive."
Thank you.
"So for instance, go back to the ta@@ per@@ ing regi@@ men that I was given@@ ."
We inter@@ view them in their living roo@@ ms.
"They expect their partner@@ s, their s@@ pou@@ ses, their wi@@ ves, to work outside the home and be just as committed to their care@@ ers as they are."
"In it, they teach physi@@ cians how to ta@@ per opio@@ ids in the easier cases, and one of the their recommen@@ da@@ tions is that you never start at more than a 10 percent dose redu@@ ction per wee@@ k."
"So, I set up scientific crit@@ eria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer."
C@@ la@@ im your experience.
"I took a picture of this, hu@@ gged her and walked away."
"Instead, the contex@@ t, the common ground activi@@ ties, are the content on television that's driving the conversa@@ tions."
So first I started with the mind.
"It's called apro@@ pos of the Italian ada@@ ge that I lif@@ ted from his forwar@@ d, ""@@ If This Be T@@ reason@@ ."""
"So remember, you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you, keeping you health@@ y."
But this one died at the age of 1@@ 6.
"And so it makes you wonder@@ , what would happen if we ha@@ dn't tas@@ ted the fruit of knowled@@ ge, so to spea@@ k, and what kind of mor@@ ality would we ha@@ ve."
I was allowed to bring my baby to work.
"You go to the websi@@ te, fill out the for@@ m, give them $@@ 6@@ 0, it arri@@ ves in the post@@ ."
Can we build an intelligent compu@@ ter@@ ?
"In@@ vest@@ , invest@@ , invest@@ ."""
And that's me right there in a bro@@ wn co@@ at.
"Th@@ en, if we take this specific pattern of micro@@ RN@@ A of this person's samp@@ les and compare it with existing scientific documenta@@ tion that cor@@ rela@@ tes micro@@ RN@@ A patterns with a specific presence of a disease, this is how pancreatic cancer looks like@@ ."
"If you save very little, the future self is un@@ happy living on 4@@ 4 percent of the in@@ come@@ ."
Than@@ ks very much.
"(Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order to have a pol@@ ite conversa@@ tion, we just had to follow the advice of H@@ en@@ ry Hig@@ gin@@ s in ""@@ My F@@ air L@@ ad@@ y@@ ""@@ : S@@ tic@@ k to the weather and your health."
The first group started in the study when they were so@@ pho@@ mor@@ es at Har@@ v@@ ard Col@@ leg@@ e.
"So, this is the web@@ site of the National Can@@ cer Institu@@ te."
"So where did it come fro@@ m, and how did it get her@@ e?"
"So with the ma@@ ps that we make on boar@@ d, we get about 100@@ -@@ meter resolu@@ tion, enough to pick out areas to dep@@ lo@@ y our equip@@ ment, but not enough to see very mu@@ ch."
"(Laughter) O@@ f course a lot of this was ton@@ gu@@ e-@@ in-@@ che@@ e@@ k, but that word femin@@ ist is so heavy with bag@@ g@@ age, negative bag@@ g@@ ag@@ e."
San@@ dr@@ ine Th@@ ure@@ t@@ : V@@ ery good.
So a second line of in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y that we use to track changes in the adoles@@ cent brain is using func@@ tional MR@@ I to look at changes in brain activity across age.
"Of course, it got much better after that."
"But then, the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happen@@ ed."
"We found that we have, on aver@@ age, 8@@ 6 billion neuron@@ s, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex@@ , and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of func@@ tions like awar@@ eness and logical and abstra@@ ct reason@@ ing, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex ha@@ s, I think this is the simplest explan@@ ation for our remarkable cognitive abili@@ ties."
"A@@ G: O@@ kay, that's a four@@ th hypo@@ thes@@ is."
I was 19@@ .
(Applause) This is fundament@@ ally a problem of human interac@@ tion.
"How do we say who or what can be part of this categor@@ y@@ ?"""
"In that case, we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environ@@ ment."
Here we're as@@ king@@ : How similar are they@@ ?
"And what's happening is that there's a glob@@ aliza@@ tion of illness oc@@ curr@@ ing, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one gener@@ ation, for example, Asi@@ a's gone from having one of the low@@ est rates of heart disease and obes@@ ity and diabetes to one of the high@@ est. And in Afri@@ ca, cardiovascular disease equ@@ als the HIV and AID@@ S death@@ s in most countri@@ es."
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for 20@@ 70 for there to be trou@@ ble.
And I think that's how we got to become human@@ .
(Laughter) So what are the first ste@@ p@@ s?
"That quo@@ te was said by a white man, Robert Mor@@ it@@ z, chair@@ person, Pri@@ ce@@ water@@ house@@ Co@@ oper@@ s, he asked me to include it in my tal@@ k."
"But if you do one step every time, maybe you don't care as mu@@ ch."
"All you have to do is prove any par@@ an@@ or@@ mal, oc@@ cul@@ t or super@@ natural event or power of any kind under proper obser@@ ving condi@@ tions."
We have this beautiful deli@@ very system that is so simple to use because it works by itself.
"Well, in par@@ t, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [@@ develo@@ ped@@ ] world, are rapidly spir@@ aling out of control, and a huge ch@@ un@@ k of those costs are human resource cost@@ s."
"Bu@@ t, you know, I want my kids to succe@@ ed in life and this isn't going to get them there."
I was fascinated by this weir@@ d concep@@ tion: viru@@ ses cur@@ ing an infec@@ tion.
""@@ "No one will mar@@ ry you this way@@ ."""
That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Th@@ ir@@ d World every year.
"Unfortunately, what is far@@ med ends up as what we e@@ at."
M@@ oral ambi@@ gu@@ ity are televi@@ sions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong.
We've got education connected to story@@ telling tri@@ ang@@ ul@@ ated next to social media.
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really pro@@ found thing about other people.
So I -- (Applause) So I tra@@ ve@@ led back to Ber@@ lin@@ .
"Once all the missing person@@ s are identi@@ fi@@ ed, only deca@@ ying bodies in their graves and these everyday ite@@ ms will remain@@ ."
We need to go visit a few medical mariju@@ ana dispens@@ ari@@ es.
This char@@ t shows the de@@ cl@@ ine in ocean wil@@ d@@ life from 19@@ 00 to 20@@ 00@@ .
"If we look at the genetic difference between human@@ s, great ap@@ es, and r@@ hes@@ us maca@@ qu@@ es, that number is seven percent."
Y@@ ay@@ ?
"I have a name for all of these condi@@ tions, it's another pre@@ condi@@ tion: I call them pre@@ post@@ er@@ ous."
And so I am going to leave you now with three call@@ s for action for those who share this vision.
What are they thinking and feel@@ ing?
"And to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab@@ ."
"The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health recor@@ d, we make sure we put a place history inside that medical recor@@ d."
And the rest of you have seen such children.
"Now, let's look at culture, the phenomen@@ on of human cultu@@ re."
So MR@@ I studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really under@@ goes dra@@ matic development during the period of adolesc@@ ence.
"I was like, ""I can@@ '@@ t, I'm expec@@ ting an email about some gol@@ d."""
"We asked him to hold his brea@@ th, and you see the signal staying at a ste@@ ad@@ y level because he ex@@ h@@ ale@@ d."
It's a question that I probably would have never really as@@ ked.
Why would we@@ ?
"And so what we did is, we measu@@ red speech at day one, and then we asked whether the proper@@ ties of the speech could predic@@ t, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psy@@ ch@@ os@@ is."
"I@@ s it something that's really going to make a difference in your lives, as an individu@@ al, as a family with autis@@ m@@ ?"
All of this is to Ameri@@ ca@@ 's sha@@ me.
These pri@@ cing vari@@ ations exis@@ ted for all the proce@@ du@@ res and all the cities that we surve@@ y@@ ed.
"And thir@@ dly, the technology is so flexible that the same device could be used to detect a bro@@ ad range of medical condi@@ tions."
I'll mar@@ ry when I want.
Because you can't treat a psychological w@@ ound if you don't even know you're inju@@ red.
"So, for example, there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you health@@ y."
They have either identi@@ cal or very similar electrical and magne@@ tic proper@@ ties.
"To start thinking about saying, ""@@ Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high co@@ st, not the things that we don't know how to do, but let's do the great things where we can do an enor@@ mous amount of good, at very low co@@ st, right now@@ ."""
(@@ H@@ igh@@ er pit@@ ch@@ ) Where did you leave my key@@ s?
[@@ it's a pen@@ is@@ ] (Laughter) I have been studying sex@@ ting since the media attention to it began in 200@@ 8.
For ma@@ th teachers maj@@ oring in ma@@ th there's a meas@@ ura@@ ble effec@@ t.
So thank you very much.
"And I had lun@@ ch with her yester@@ day because she's a college student studying dance at L@@ ong B@@ each here, and she's doing absolutely fanta@@ sti@@ c."
The one on the left wal@@ ks away because she knows already that this is not a good test for her.
"And in science, we try and remove our bi@@ as, right, by running dou@@ ble@@ -@@ blin@@ ded experi@@ ments or being statisti@@ cally ag@@ nos@@ tic as to what our results will be."
But one thing about the TR@@ AP@@ P@@ IS@@ T system is that it is tin@@ y.
I think of it as sort of a ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al.
"And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statisti@@ cs, and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different@@ ."
"They divide slow@@ ly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even di@@ ed."
So bor@@ ders are not a means of preventing infec@@ tions from enter@@ ing a country by chec@@ king temperat@@ ures.
"And she had this really aw@@ es@@ ome idea to sell the bag@@ , called the ""@@ Fe@@ ed B@@ ag@@ "" -- which is really beauti@@ fully iron@@ ic because you can stra@@ p on the Fe@@ ed B@@ ag@@ ."
That led us to think that maybe people with strong motiv@@ ations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weak@@ er motiv@@ ations.
"Th@@ ir@@ d, how does all of this very syste@@ matic structure get buil@@ t, both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our speci@@ es?"
"Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after we read the first sequ@@ ence -- this Oc@@ to@@ ber@@ , we started to see some sign@@ als."
until you forge@@ t.
"Well, fascin@@ at@@ ingly, it turns out that if you give children antibiotics in the first six months of life, they're more likely to become ob@@ ese later on than if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later, and so what we do early on may have pro@@ found impac@@ ts on the gu@@ t microbial community and on later health that we're only beginning to understan@@ d."
What's interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lif@@ el@@ ong mon@@ o@@ gam@@ y.
"(Laughter) Be@@ fore becoming a writ@@ er, N@@ ora was a financial plan@@ ner@@ ."

"C@@ h@@ ris and I sat qui@@ et@@ ly in the h@@ all@@ way, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his care@@ er."
We can do more.
Here's a little cli@@ p of something I think I did poor@@ ly.
"When evolution makes something new@@ , it uses the parts it has in sto@@ ck, off the shel@@ f, before it fabri@@ ca@@ tes a new tw@@ ist@@ ."
""@@ "A@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d."""

But we don't understand how rare galaxi@@ es form and evol@@ ve.
"I was physically health@@ y, but psycho@@ logi@@ cally, I was a mes@@ s."

"But in our growing dependence on technology, we're asse@@ t-@@ stri@@ pping those skill@@ s."
"Now there's a book actually, about K@@ I@@ P@@ P -- the place that this is going on -- that J@@ a@@ y M@@ at@@ the@@ w@@ s, a news repor@@ ter, wrote -- cal@@ led, ""W@@ or@@ k Har@@ d, Be Ni@@ ce."""
that was another version of me: one who will con@@ quer the world.

It's not special to us.
"(Laughter) (Applause) ""@@ T@@ ill mor@@ row@@ ."

"(Laughter) As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speak@@ ers."

Then we have ti@@ mb@@ re.
"This is the real mad@@ ness, because there is no cos@@ mic rul@@ e that says that great suffering equ@@ als great rewar@@ d, but we talk about love as if this is true."

At the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agre@@ ed with the conclu@@ sions of the artic@@ le.

W@@ ant to join me?
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to re@@ mind them to stop eating when their sto@@ ma@@ ch is [@@ 80@@ ] percent ful@@ l.
"E@@ ach time they ignore me, I feel invisi@@ ble."
"My mother is a cin@@ n@@ amon@@ -@@ skin daughter of a na@@ tive Brazili@@ an, with a pin@@ ch of ha@@ z@@ el and hon@@ e@@ y, and a man [@@ who is@@ ] a mi@@ x of coffee with mil@@ k, but with a lot of coffe@@ e."

"To find out, we designed some experiment@@ s."
I think that Arabi@@ c scri@@ pt tou@@ ches your soul before it reach@@ es your eyes.
Sometimes it looks a little more like this.
I also get to work with pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logists and ar@@ cha@@ eo@@ logi@@ sts.
There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.
"When veter@@ ans come home from war@@ , their way of ment@@ ally fra@@ ming the world is cali@@ bra@@ ted to an im@@ men@@ sely more dangerous environ@@ ment."
"So this is a wo@@ man, 4@@ 6 years old, who had recur@@ ren@@ t lun@@ g cancer."
"It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dream@@ less sleep, and it goes on all day until you fall as@@ le@@ ep or die or other@@ wise become un@@ consci@@ ous."
"But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this di@@ sta@@ ste that people still have for the idea of treat@@ ment, the no@@ tion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indi@@ gent communi@@ ties, that would be explo@@ ita@@ tive, because we would be changing them."
"Th@@ ink of it as being kind of the bul@@ l@@ do@@ zing of a city or of a for@@ est, because it clear@@ s it away."
"It stri@@ kes me as a giant idea, and you're going to need a lot of people che@@ ering you on your way to make it happen@@ ."
"No@@ body has a clu@@ e, despite all the exper@@ ti@@ se that's been on par@@ ade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five year@@ s' time."
"So, L@@ eti@@ cia called in the gr@@ and j@@ ur@@ y, and several ar@@ rest@@ s have been ma@@ de."
"So 2,000 years later, another philosop@@ her, L@@ ud@@ wi@@ g W@@ it@@ t@@ gen@@ ste@@ in, put it like this: ""@@ De@@ ath is not an event in life@@ : We do not live to experience death@@ ."
F@@ ort@@ y-@@ five percent of the prescri@@ p@@ tions written in doctor@@ 's offi@@ ces are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help.
"Now, our group at MI@@ T is trying to take a different point of view from the way neuro@@ science has been done over the last hundred years."
"Secon@@ d, understanding society and cultu@@ re."
"In this other version of the experi@@ ment, we didn't put people in this situa@@ tion, we just described to them the situa@@ tion, much as I am describ@@ ing to you now, and we asked them to predict what the result would be."
But I know what you're thin@@ king.
What's tren@@ ding now? What's the popular talk now?
"And we also use func@@ tional MR@@ I, called f@@ MR@@ I, to take a vide@@ o, a movi@@ e, of brain activity when partici@@ pants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or percei@@ ving some@@ thing."
You see there that Swe@@ den does better than B@@ rita@@ in all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y.
But the companies with@@ held that data from them.
"Now while this may be the low-@@ economi@@ c@@ -@@ cost solu@@ tion, this is certainly not the low-@@ environmental or human health@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ safety solution."
I care about the technology.
And mother got time to read for me.
Th@@ ere@@ fore they were not authen@@ tically Afri@@ can.
Those who expect the future to be bet@@ ter@@ : a wh@@ opp@@ ing 8@@ 2 percent@@ .
"A@@ s@@ king patients about their hop@@ es, their fear@@ s, their goals and prefer@@ en@@ ces."
"And my team discovered an extremely rare one, a gal@@ ax@@ y that doesn't look quite like anything obser@@ ved before."
"So now many of you see a sna@@ ke, and why is that@@ ?"
"Of course, the physi@@ ology is extremely important, but it's not the only reason why we feel the way we do at any given moment."
And they were ready to let the kid go.
"One is asking for angu@@ r -- one is, say, an English@@ man -- one is asking for ene@@ b@@ , and one is asking for grap@@ es."
"So, this o@@ ak@@ -@@ pan@@ ele@@ d room, and she was there with her mother@@ , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems G@@ illi@@ an was having at school, because she was dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing people, her home@@ work was always la@@ te, and so on."
"I can even imagine a day when it's routine for people to have a DB@@ C to connect to their home computer or smart phone as a means to down@@ load their prescri@@ p@@ tions, such as insulin or anti@@ body therapi@@ es."
and we tail@@ or the class towards the aver@@ age.
But there's a problem with this ros@@ y picture of kids being so much better than adul@@ ts.
"The sad reality is, we develop vaccin@@ es not based upon the risk the patho@@ gen po@@ ses to people, but on how economi@@ cally risk@@ y it is to develop these vaccin@@ es."
"But than@@ k@@ ful@@ ly, today, most of humanity lives in far more peaceful socie@@ ties, and when there is conflic@@ t, w@@ e, especially in the United States, now have the technology to put our war@@ ri@@ ors through advanced train@@ ing, drop them in to fight any@@ where on the glo@@ be and when they're done, j@@ et them back to peace@@ time sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a."
And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him -- O@@ liver Sac@@ ks is going to be born way in the future.
"We see these ideas again and again in the media, in public health polic@@ y, doctor@@ s' offi@@ ces, in everyday conversations and in our own at@@ titu@@ des."
"[@@ Who are the people who should be most concerned about this@@ ?] Well, the most concerned are people who are, first of all, in developing countries and who don't have access to good medical care and may not have access at all to a hospit@@ al, should an epi@@ demic occu@@ r in their countr@@ y."
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connec@@ tions that this kind of thinking has led me to.
"For example, I found if I just don't run@@ , if I got rejec@@ ted, I could actually turn a ""@@ no@@ "" into a ""@@ y@@ es@@ ,"" and the magic word is, ""@@ wh@@ y."""
And those of you who have under@@ gone colon@@ os@@ copy as part of a scre@@ ening program for color@@ ec@@ tal cancer will know what I mean@@ .
"If you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman and the wai@@ ter gre@@ ets only you, does it occu@@ r to you to ask the wait@@ er, ""Why haven't you gre@@ e@@ ted her@@ ?"""
"The first one is that these little 18 month@@ -@@ old babies have already discovered this really pro@@ found fact about human nature@@ , that we don't always want the same thing."
"And so in this place with the same vulner@@ abili@@ ties, the same streng@@ th@@ s, the same fear@@ s, the same hop@@ es, I hope that we work together with jo@@ y."
"Well, as we say in the busin@@ ess, X mar@@ ks the spo@@ t."
She ac@@ cu@@ sed her mother of sexual ab@@ use based on a repres@@ sed memory.
She was in control.
"C@@ h@@ ris Ander@@ son: So, you've been obses@@ sed with this problem for the last few years."
We think we can communicate because we have this common code that pres@@ ents meaning.
"Well, along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issu@@ es, like, when should we use this mind technolog@@ y?"
And what's under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy.
19@@ 0 head@@ s of state -- nine are women.
M@@ oral skill is chi@@ pped away by an over@@ -@@ reli@@ ance on rules that de@@ pri@@ ves us of the opportunity to impro@@ vi@@ se and learn from our impro@@ vi@@ sa@@ tions.
"By 20@@ 3@@ 0, if the mai@@ z@@ e, or cor@@ n, vari@@ eti@@ es, which is the domin@@ ant cro@@ p -- 50 percent of the nutri@@ tion in Sou@@ thern Africa are still in the field -- in 20@@ 3@@ 0, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of mai@@ ze because of the climate change already in 20@@ 30@@ ."
"N@@ or@@ mal@@ ity over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wron@@ g."
Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today@@ ?
And then I showed it to the ligh@@ ting director and she got exci@@ ted.
Well people have spec@@ ul@@ ated that it was 201@@ 4 World C@@ up soccer fan@@ s that brought the virus into the country.
(Laughter) N@@ el@@ son Man@@ dela then went down to the stage and he sum@@ mari@@ zed the challenge for us all.
"I'm grateful to ment@@ ors, colleagu@@ es, and collabor@@ ators around the world."
(Laughter) My brain has the ability to hy@@ per@@ -@@ focus on things that interest me.
"And in one gener@@ ation, they're going from hun@@ ger and all of the de@@ tri@@ mental health effects of hun@@ ger to obes@@ ity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one gener@@ ation."
"They are linked to risk@@ s, los@@ ses."
"After five years, it went away on its ow@@ n."
It's analy@@ zing tren@@ ds. It's predic@@ ting the future.
"I'm Mc@@ Ken@@ na Po@@ pe. I'm 14 years old, and when I was 1@@ 3, I convinced one of the largest toy compani@@ es, to@@ y@@ ma@@ k@@ ers, in the world, Has@@ bro@@ , to change the way that they mar@@ ke@@ ted one of their most b@@ est@@ -@@ se@@ lling produc@@ ts."
And that's happened more than one time.
"Well, in the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m, Dan@@ ny expla@@ ine@@ d, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wron@@ g, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happen@@ ing, or to minimi@@ ze the dama@@ ge."
"A person with an AC@@ E sco@@ re of seven or more had tri@@ ple the life@@ time risk of lun@@ g cancer and three and a half times the risk of is@@ che@@ mic heart disease, the number one kil@@ ler in the United States of Ameri@@ ca."
And along the way I discovered that a lot of great origin@@ als in history were procrastin@@ at@@ ors.
And he did.
And then the anxiety set in.
"W@@ hy this is interesting is because in the past deca@@ de, we have found that this is not just some ano@@ mal@@ y of this ridi@@ cul@@ ous, g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ dark bacteri@@ um that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this."
Think of the logi@@ c.
"And that was done also without per@@ mis@@ sion, although no one seemed to car@@ e."
"As a photograph@@ er, I realize that I can be a chan@@ nel for others to communica@@ te."
You can also se@@ w by@@ pass vessel@@ s directly onto a beating heart without cra@@ cking the ch@@ est.
"And here, you have the two color to@@ k@@ en@@ s."
"And they didn't raise their han@@ ds, but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expen@@ se report@@ s."
It's a terrible experience for people.
And the third is commitment.
"When a language di@@ es, we don't know what we lose with that language."
"I said, ""W@@ ow, great@@ , I'm already learning things."
There are tens of thousands of miles of de@@ water@@ ed stre@@ ams in the United Sta@@ tes.
We went to their homes and we interview@@ ed their par@@ ents.
"C@@ ur@@ r@@ ently, my brother and I are working on projects all over the country, but last spr@@ ing we started a projec@@ t, here actually at Stan@@ for@@ d's Ex@@ peri@@ mental Medi@@ a Art De@@ part@@ ment, where we're creating our largest loca@@ tion@@ -@@ aware al@@ b@@ um to da@@ te, one that will sp@@ an the enti@@ re@@ ty of H@@ igh@@ way 1 here on the Pa@@ ci@@ fic Co@@ ast@@ ."
"Now, an interesting challen@@ ge@@ : Can we predict a human face@@ ?"
"(Laughter) Now I've got four or five pen@@ gu@@ ins flo@@ ating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shoo@@ ting away."
"Now, part of that is due to technolog@@ y."
We see the bonds of family connec@@ tions.
"Now most people think that's because plas@@ tics are a th@@ row@@ -@@ away materi@@ al, have very little valu@@ e."
"In@@ de@@ ed, we stand at a remarkable time in human history, where, dri@@ ven by ref@@ us@@ al to accept the limits of our bodies and our min@@ ds, we are building machines of ex@@ quisi@@ te, beautiful complex@@ ity and gra@@ ce that will exten@@ d the human experience in ways beyond our imagin@@ ing."
One of the most stri@@ king proper@@ ties about life is that it has color.
"Be@@ cause, by Western defini@@ tions, a so@@ -@@ called civil society has to be separate or even in op@@ position to the political system, but that concept is ali@@ en for Chinese cultu@@ re."
The second best thing would be to focus on mal@@ nutri@@ tion.
"So we've measu@@ red -- this is again, notice no tail and hair@@ less, this is a medical stud@@ ent."
It's about a six@@ -year project to make 100 of these human@@ s.
"Y@@ ea@@ h, we can."
"When E@@ bola stru@@ ck Liber@@ ia, there were less than 50 doctors in the entire country of 4@@ .@@ 5 million people."
"Lo@@ o@@ ks like you don't have the power@@ ."""
The technology for oxygen deli@@ very is not new.
"You had this same thing in America, it was called the Ti@@ me@@ x Sin@@ cla@@ ir@@ 100@@ 0@@ ."
"Because this can be taken for advertis@@ ing, and because of the law@@ , it has to be taken down@@ ."""
"When she shows up, it's a big happy reuni@@ on."
"In many forms of blin@@ d@@ ness, like re@@ tin@@ i@@ ti@@ s pi@@ g@@ ment@@ osa or ma@@ cular de@@ gener@@ ation, the pho@@ tor@@ ec@@ ep@@ tor cells have atro@@ p@@ hi@@ ed or been destro@@ y@@ ed."
"(Laughter) I know, you're as bad as the six@@ th@@ -@@ gra@@ der@@ s."
"And then, in early 201@@ 5, there was an up@@ sur@@ ge of cases of a den@@ gu@@ e-@@ like syn@@ dro@@ me in the city of Na@@ tal in nor@@ the@@ astern Braz@@ il@@ ."
"This isn't min@@ e, it's a 50@@ -year-old paradi@@ g@@ m called the ""@@ free choice paradi@@ g@@ m."""
"I believe this passion@@ ately, that we don't grow into creativ@@ ity, we grow out of it."
"We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, ""How did you do@@ ?"""
"(Laughter) N@@ o, she was one of our most creative students, and as an organiza@@ tional psycho@@ logi@@ st, this is the kind of idea that I test@@ ."
"But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is appro@@ ved, tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treat@@ ments."
"Al@@ most goes to E, but other@@ wise the play would be over@@ ."
"It's a massive s@@ lab of human gen@@ i@@ us, up there with the T@@ a@@ j Ma@@ h@@ al, the Mon@@ a Li@@ sa, and the ice cream sand@@ wi@@ ch -- and the table@@ 's cre@@ at@@ or, D@@ mit@@ ri Men@@ dele@@ ev@@ , is a bon@@ afi@@ de science h@@ all@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fa@@ mer@@ ."
"In about the first billi@@ on@@ th of a second or so, the Hig@@ gs field ki@@ cked in, and the quar@@ ks and the glu@@ ons and the electr@@ ons that make us up got mas@@ s."
"F@@ our first ste@@ ps that are essential to get everything else done, four first ste@@ ps that everyone can get started with@@ , four first ste@@ ps that decide about everything that can happen af@@ ter."
S@@ he's being fil@@ med with a hidden camera.
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
I hope that's your goal.
We tend to think of it as an in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent given@@ .
So the idea was there.
"There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telesco@@ p@@ es, sensitive to op@@ tical radi@@ ation, as our eyes are."
G@@ o and get a voice co@@ ach@@ .
"CA: So what's your idea, then, to try to change that in plas@@ tic@@ s?"
"And ""@@ fu@@ "" means ""@@ pill@@ ar@@ ."""
And I just wai@@ ted for the time that I could go off and read my books.
"How much sun@@ light is safe@@ , and how can we fin@@ esse this best for our general health@@ ?"
"So, I'll be speaking to you using language ..."
"But what it does do is to make and secre@@ te small molecules that you can think of like hormon@@ es, and these are the red tri@@ ang@@ les."
"So it measures ac@@ cel@@ era@@ tion, ang@@ ular ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation -- like a human ear@@ , inner ear@@ ."
"In a cu@@ bi@@ c milli@@ meter of your brain, there are about 100@@ ,000 of these neurons and maybe a billion of those connec@@ tions."
Let's talk a little bit about some of the compon@@ ents that go into these cour@@ ses.
"W@@ hat's going on@@ ?"""
"B@@ ac@@ teri@@ a have been on the ear@@ th for billions of year@@ s; human@@ s, couple hundred thou@@ san@@ d."
This is what we mean by biological tele@@ por@@ tation.
"@@ Have you ever had to fill out those long@@ , le@@ gal@@ -@@ size forms in your doctor@@ 's offi@@ ce@@ ?"
"But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stres@@ s."
"I was working with this young pi@@ ani@@ st, and said, ""The trouble with you is you're a tw@@ o-@@ but@@ to@@ ck play@@ er."
"You're not showing any imp@@ air@@ ments in memor@@ y, language, or cognition ..."
O@@ kin@@ aw@@ a is actually 16@@ 1 small is@@ lan@@ ds.
What the s@@ qui@@ d has developed is a sh@@ u@@ t@@ ter that can open and close over the specialized light organ hou@@ sing the bacteri@@ a.
"And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defen@@ ders, but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it, we can end tort@@ ure as an investiga@@ tive tool@@ ."
"And we believe that these respon@@ ses in high@@ er-@@ order areas are indu@@ ced or become similar across listen@@ ers because of the meaning conve@@ yed by the speak@@ er, and not by words or soun@@ d."
"But it's not just the kind of s@@ pra@@ w@@ l you think of, or many people think of, as low-@@ den@@ sity development out at the peri@@ pher@@ y of the metro@@ po@@ lit@@ an are@@ a."
"So, it's simple. All you need are those top qu@@ arti@@ le teacher@@ s."
And this sort of re@@ pur@@ posing is actually quite challeng@@ ing.
"So I think after several gener@@ a@@ tions, and here is the idea, we really have a tin@@ der@@ box@@ ."
You can follow it through the fossil recor@@ d.
The Chinese govern@@ ment.
(Applause) Chris Ander@@ son: That was super@@ b@@ . Thank you so much.
"But when she sees Mi@@ ke taking girls home from parti@@ es, she's worried about them."
"E@@ ither a conscious ag@@ ent is carrying out the computa@@ tion, or he's got a piece of machin@@ ery that ad@@ m@@ its of a computa@@ tional interpre@@ ta@@ tion."
"A@@ sh@@ ley Jud@@ d: Thank you, J@@ es@@ us. Ma@@ y your gra@@ ce and mer@@ cy shin@@ e."
That was a huge thing for me.
"R@@ igh@@ t? At that spe@@ ed, they go around that 27 kilometers 1@@ 1@@ ,000 times a secon@@ d."
"So those seem like two bi@@ fur@@ ca@@ ted proble@@ ms, but I kind of started to think about, you know, what is obes@@ ity and hun@@ ger@@ ?"
"(Laughter) And then after my treat@@ ment, it just felt like everyone was telling me what my experience was going to mean@@ ."
"We're tra@@ cking her head with little pel@@ le@@ ts in a cap@@ , so she's free to move completely un@@ con@@ stra@@ ine@@ d."
"Be@@ fore you go into the next stressful evalua@@ tive situa@@ tion, for two minutes, try doing this, in the elev@@ at@@ or, in a bathroom st@@ all, at your des@@ k behind clo@@ sed do@@ or@@ s."
"Because remember, we tend to associ@@ ate liber@@ al@@ ism with democracy -- that's a mistak@@ e, histori@@ call@@ y."
I was raised in an economi@@ cally and emotionally star@@ ved environment.
"And out of the woo@@ d@@ work@@ s, all of these people come out and they start to give cha@@ se."
"So basi@@ cally, what this focu@@ ses on is saying, we can do a lot more by invest@@ ing in preven@@ tion."
"I haven't told many people this, but in my head, I've got thousands of secret worl@@ ds all going on all at the same time."
So I'm very hope@@ ful.
"We're going to do some open-@@ heart surger@@ y. I was the only B@@ rit@@ , on a team of about nine American car@@ dia@@ c sur@@ ge@@ ons, car@@ dia@@ c nur@@ se, inten@@ sive care nur@@ se."
"And so, in many of our cour@@ ses, the medi@@ an response time for a question on the question and answer for@@ um was 2@@ 2 minu@@ tes."
And I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do.
But it's also really important that we don't get distrac@@ ted by the theater or the mor@@ als of it.
So he went to P@@ apu@@ a New Gu@@ ine@@ a.

"So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earli@@ er today, we say that W@@ illi@@ am B@@ la@@ ke is more of a human than Ger@@ tru@@ de Ste@@ in."
"D@@ uring the first year of medical train@@ ing, as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseas@@ es, suddenly you realize you have all of them."
So it has to come out of you and out into the open for people to see.
"But the good news is, pha@@ ges have stuck aroun@@ d."
But the point is we're not ap@@ es.
Min@@ d@@ less@@ ly taking the first small ste@@ p.

"Now, he tri@@ es E again, and that doesn't work."

"When his mother put on one of his favorite recor@@ ds, he would correc@@ tly declar@@ e, ""@@ Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ !"""
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equip@@ ment.
