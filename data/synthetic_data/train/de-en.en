"Dear 16-year-old self,  I am writing to you from the future, as I am now much older and wiser than you are. There are a few things I would like to tell you that I wish I could have known when I was your age.  Firstly, don't worry too much about what other people think of you. You are smart, talented and wonderful just the way you are, and anyone who cannot see that is not worth your time.  Secondly, don't be afraid to take risks and try new things. Life is full of opportunities, and it's up to you to make the most of them. Don't be afraid of failure, as it is often the best way to learn and grow.  Thirdly, be kind to yourself and others. Everyone has their own struggles and challenges, and a little bit of kindness can go a long way. Be patient and understanding, and treat others with the same respect and kindness that you would like to receive.  Finally, always remember to believe in yourself and your dreams. You have the power to achieve anything that you set your mind to, as long as you work hard and stay focused.  I hope that these words of wisdom will serve you well in the years to come. Keep chasing your dreams, and never forget that you are capable of achieving great things.  Yours truly, Your older and wiser self."
